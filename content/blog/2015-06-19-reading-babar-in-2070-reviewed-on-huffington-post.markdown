title: READING BABAR IN 2070 Reviewed On Huffington Post!
---

So I guess my Google Alert is good for things other than  telling me every time that I write a new blog post, because today it alerted me to the fact that READING BABAR IN 2070 was mentioned on [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/)! Here's what [George Heymont](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-heymont/) had to say on my ten-minute play from the [Best of PlayGround Festival 19](http://playground-sf.org/bestof/):

>"Written by Rachel Bublitz and directed by Rebecca Ennals, Reading Babar in 2070 is filled with the kinds of twists and turns worthy of a short story by Guy de Maupassant. As the action begins, a very pregnant Lucia (Stephanie Prentice) is asleep on the couch, taking a nap. When her husband, Michael (Michael Barrett Austin) and daughter Tina (Millie DeBenedet) return from grocery shopping and a trip to the library, Tina launches into an impassioned speech about why she loves elephants and asks her parents to read a book to her that she brought home from the library.

>"The politically correct Lucia scolds her husband for bringing home a book about Babar the Elephant, explaining that it's not really about elephants at all. But there is no stopping Tina, whose love for elephants nearly surpasses her love for her parents.

>"Lucia's self-righteous bubble quickly bursts when the conversation turns to the fact that, with the exception of the few pachyderms living in zoos, in 2070 elephants are extinct. With a child's laser-like instincts, Tina asks what her parents did to help save the elephants, only to learn that when Lucia and Michael were in college they were "too busy" to pay attention."
