title: My Dude Play Has A Title!
---

I know so many writers that title things without a worry or a care. Writers that have titles for their work pop out to them while they stroll down the street, day dreaming of how wonderful their life is because titling comes so naturally to them. I am not one of those writers. I'm the obnoxious writer that texts and emails her friends choices and choices and choices of titles until past midnight for days asking them to pick their favorite. Because I have such a hard time, I've found a few tricks* that help me, and I try my damnedest to stick to them. 

First trick, title *before* you start writing the thing. For a long time I would just give it the working-title of my main character and put off the task for as long as possible, hoping it would come to me. It has never just come to me. So when I started pages on my play about male body image without a title, I was more than a little perturbed. BUT THEN IT ACTUALLY JUST CAME TO ME! Like it happens to writers in the movies! It's actually a line from the play, which is normally something I don't go in for, but this feels right for this play. I'm also having the best time writing it, so I think that helps too. 

SO GUYS, my new title for my (first) all male cast full length is: *LET'S FIX ANDY*. 

It is no longer "Man Dude Bro" which has been the bane of my existence since I started using it. I'm also making exciting discoveries on this play's writing path, and using some new to me theatrical devices. Basically, for now, I'm in love. I realize it's going to swing back the other way and I'll feel stupid and terrible at writing soon, but I'm going to ride this wave for as long as I can.

And speaking of waves, I've got to get back to it, *LET'S FIX ANDY* isn't going to write itself.

*Sorry if you thought there would be more tips for titling things. I misled you, but I only really have the one tip, anyway.
