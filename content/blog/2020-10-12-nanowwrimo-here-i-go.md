Hello hello! It's been quite a while! This wasn't just your run of the mill, average overwhelmed and panicked break, I was recovering (am recovering?) from a mild concussion through most of September up to now. In early September Northern Utah had a freak windstorm. Large swaths of the population lost power, thousands of trees were knocked over, and I got hit in the head with a piece of flying debris. It was a small branch... I get that branch sounds very dramatic, but it was bigger than just a stick. For sure a branch, just a very small one. I spent two days writing really strange emails, saying things to my family that confused everyone, and suffering from non-stop headaches before I saw my doctor. I thought it was nothing. But, at my appointment my doc took one look at me and said you have a concussion. 

I had to go off my computer, off the TV, off reading books, off Sudoko, off of everything really except in-person conversations and watching my chickens run around my yard. It took close to two and a half weeks before I was no longer altered, and another week or two before my headaches stopped. This is the first week I've tried to write anything more than a couple of paragraphs. So far (thankfully!) it's going well! Which brings me to my wild plan for November (when I expect to be 100% myself again)....

[NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/)! That fantastic and near-impossible writing challenge where folks write an entire novel during the month of November! Now I have never written a novel, but I'd meant to last Spring. Before the Pandemic made the world go side-ways I'd intended to adapt my play [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://www.pioneerdrama.com/SearchDetail.asp?pc=CHEERLEADE&id=0) into a young adult novel. It's something I've been toying around with for a looooong long time, and finally the stars have all aligned for me to take the plunge and just do it. Turns out it only took theater screeching to a halt for me to write something other than a play.

I'm planning to take it easy the rest of October, to give my brain as much time to recover before November as possible... But come on back! I will be popping up to announce some fun things that are coming down the pipeline. Two that are happening this month:

[*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/browse/digital-scripts/the-night-witches-digital-script) has TWO Zoom productions this month:

University of Utah opens *THE NIGHT WITCHES* October 23rd and runs through November 1st, directed by Alexandra Harbold. [Click here for more details and to get tickets!](https://theatre.utah.edu/this-season/2020-2021-season/item/541-the-night-witches)

Hope wherever you are you are healthy and sane, and please please please watch out for branches of all size flying through the air!
