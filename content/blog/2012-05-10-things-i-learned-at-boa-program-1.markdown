title: The 6 Things I Learned at BOA Program 1
---

I went to BOA Program 1 last night. I want to start out by saying how much I didn't want to go. I had woken up on the wrong side of them bed, and never seemed to fully wake up. And all day my four year old kept begging me not to go out. But my ticket had been purchased and it was the only night that I had to see BOA. So, into the city I went. Here is what I learned:

1. Even if you do not want to be out, you will have an amazing time at BOA. I was completely blown away by the performances I saw last night. 

2. BOA creates a beautiful theatre community. I find theatre most inspiring when it embraces community, and BOA gets together a lot of small companies in the bay area to form one great and mighty theatre community. It was inspiring. 

3. It made me want to run home and write an amazing one act so that I could be involved in next years festival. Stay tuned, I'll be writing feverishly over the next few days!

4. The show was packed on a Wednesday night! If you want tickets to the remaining performances, buy your tickets now! Click [here](https://www.ticketturtle.com/index.php?ticketing=boa) for tickets.

5. Good art pumps me up. I was home by midnight (a few hours past my normal bed time) but that didn't stop me from waking up my husband to tell him about the great night of theatre I got to enjoy. I can still feel the buzz and it is good.

6. And last but not least, see both programs. I, sadly, cannot make it to Program 2, and I'm devastated! Don't put yourself through the heartache, and make sure to get tickets to both programs.

That is all. Get out, go see something, go make something. It is better than television, I promise you. And you should know, in case you were nervous, your TV will probably still be there when you get home. Especially if you lock the door on your way out.
