It's April 23rd! Only *one* week left for reading and recommending plays on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) in hopes to get that wonderful [National New Play Network](http://nnpn.org/) button... Yes, I really really like buttons. 

Here's what I got to recommending over the weekend:

* ["*The Woman American*" by Samantha Cooper](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/29126/woman-american) - I really really *loved* this play!
* ["*Retch Gag Spew Hurl Heave Eject*" by Samantha Cooper](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/29134/retch-gag-spew-hurl-heave-eject)
* ["*BROKE/FIX*" by Gina Femia](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/88049/brokefix)
* ["*FRIENDS WITH GUNS*" by Stephanie Alison Walker](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/127688/friends-guns)
* ["*FATIMA & MAAMA: A Ten-Minute TFY Play*" by Asher Wyndham](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/39246/fatima-maama-ten-minute-tfy-play)
* ["*RUFF! RUFF! RUFF! A One-Minute Play for Two Kids*" by Asher Wyndham](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/192177/ruff-ruff-ruff-one-minute-play-two-kids)
* ["*The End of the Road*" by Claudia Haas](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138932/end-road)
* ["*The First Step (a one minute play)*" by Kat Ramsburg](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/33011/first-step-one-minute-play)

Who and what will I stumble over in these last seven days? I can't wait to find out!

If you want in on the fun, start reading plays on the New Play Exchange, and for all the ones you like, write a recommendation. Once you've done that, [fill out the NNPN April Recommendation google doc](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezBOsFEj5Vfp3wDvn6k1w-0dVivE0afyVFOf6mVSGPntJKzw/viewform), and if you're in the top 20, you've got a button coming your way!

Happy Monday and Happy Reading everyone!
