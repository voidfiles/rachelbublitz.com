title: GERYON poster by Rogernald "Rusty" Jackson!
---

One of the things that makes the [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) so dear to my heart is the partnership they strike each year with such a wide variety or artists. The posters for this year's Monster Ball have just been released and there is such a beautiful variety, as there is every year. I am very proud to share the poster inspired by GERYON, the monster that inspired my play *The Red House Monster*.

Here it is:
