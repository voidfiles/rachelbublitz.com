"The Anniversary" has made it to the next round in the Lakeshore Players' competition! I just received this email:

>Your play is one of only 20 out of over 350 entries to make it to the final round.  On March 24, 2012, we will be announcing the winning plays.  The winning plays will then be produced and performed from June 7th through 10th, at our 8th Annual Ten-Minute Play Festival.

My fingers are crossed!
