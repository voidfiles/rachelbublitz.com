I have been running behind on my submissions! Oy! I've done a bit of catch up today, submitted three scripts and now I'm all caught up. I have a ton I need to print and mail off, hopefully getting to those before the weekend... I'd like to stay ahead of the game! 

Here's what and where I submitted today:

I emailed "Nap Time" and "How Terry Gross Destroyed My Life" to [Acme Theater](http://www.acmetheater.com/nwwf.asp). They are looking for 10 minute plays for their ACME NEW WORKS WINTER FESTIVAL 2013. They don't have a stated theme, they will accept 2 plays per playwright, no submission fee, and the deadline is September 15th.

I uploaded "My Body" to the [Source Festival website](https://secure.jotform.com/form/22336056889160). They are also looking for 10 minute plays, and they also do not have a theme. They want plays that have not been produced or published as of October 2012. You'll need to upload a resume and the pdf of the play directly to the website listed above. The deadline is October 2nd, 2012.

It's the 5th, and I'm up to 5 submissions this month. Only 25 left to go!
