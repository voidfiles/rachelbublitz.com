title: 30 Script Submissions For The Month Of May
---

May was a good month, I was only 1 shy of my goal on submitting a script per day. Adding on the 130 submissions I'd made before May, my new total is 160! As of June 1st, there's been 151 days come and gone, so I still have a little wiggle room on my total, but I'm hoping to hit 200 submission before the 200th day of the year (July 19th). 

Will I make it all the way to 365 submissions this year? Only one way to find out, and that's to check back for my next submission tally!
