Posting from Hawaii, so aloha! Last month I was super productive, and I submitted more last month than I have in any other month! Woo! My total was 55! That's right, I submitted 55 plays! I hope I can keep it up, I have 255 *more* plays to submit this year. I know not a whole lot will be getting done this week, on the island, I'll have to pick up the pace when I get home.

I have some fun stuff I'll be announcing when I'm back next week, so stay tuned!
