title: THE ELVES Joins ShortLived Round 5 at PianoFight
---

Exciting news! My dark Christmas comedy *The Elves* joins the line-up for [PianoFight](http://www.pianofight.com/)'s [ShortLived](http://www.pianofight.com/shortlived/) Competition, "The nation's largest, audience-judged theater competition," according to [KQED](http://www.kqed.org/)! I'm in Round 5, which kicks off a week from Thursday, and I need you to go watch and vote so I can move on the finals. If you haven't made it out to PianoFight's new space, now you have the perfect excuse, because it's guaranteed to be an awesome time. Here's the full line-up for my round:

BOARDMAN ALLEY CATS - *Glammademoiselle*

THOSE WOMEN PRODUCTIONS - *Craving, a monologue*

RACHEL BUBLITZ - *The Elves* 

JEFF DUNN - *Castle Happy*

SPENCER BAINBRIDGE - *The Futurists*

BENNETT FISHER - *Peckish*

And you'll have four chances to check it out, it runs Thursday March 31st at 8pm, Friday April 1st at 8pm, and Saturday April 2nd at 5pm and 8pm.

So go buy your tickets: [TICKETS!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/shortlived-round-5-tickets-21531438111) And tell all your friends to buy some tickets, because this is going to be a hoot!
