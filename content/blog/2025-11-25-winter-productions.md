Thanksgiving is just days away! With winter almost here I wanted to take a moment to hype my upcoming productions around the country (and one in Canada!). I'm thrilled for all of my plays to get produced, of course, but I am especially thrilled for a few of these productions...

[*The Hardy Girls*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/hardy-girls) is getting its first and second ever productions!! It's first  will happen at Hanahan High School in Hanahan, South Carolina in December, (a world premiere!)! It's second production will be at the New School for the Arts & Academics in Tempe, Arizona in February! To find out more about *The Hardy Girls*, find it here at [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/hardy-girls).

The second play I'd like to draw attention to is [*Burst*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/browse/burst) happening at Niagara University this February. I have always thought that *Burst* would make for amazing material for colleges, and I'm so glad to have this university production to test my intuition! For more info about *Burst*, find it here at [Dramatic Publishing](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/browse/burst).

Finally, the last production(s) I want to highlight come from my holiday collection: [*Holly, Jolly, & Extra Folly*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/holly-jolly-extra-folly)! The full collection is getting produced by Graham High School Theatre Department in Graham, North Carolina, but ten minute plays from this collection have also been selected for productions; [*How Gretchen Stole Christmas*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/how-santa-stole-christmas), [*Reindeer Games*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/reindeer-games), and one of my all time favorites, [*Santa's Old Friend*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/santa-s-old-friend). It's very heartening to see my holiday plays getting attention, especially as I'm about to set out to write a brand new full-length Christmastime play! As you wait for that to be written, find the full collection of *Holly, Jolly, & Extra Folly* with [Stage Partners right here](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/holly-jolly-extra-folly)!

Here's a full list of my plays happening in the coming months, if you're nearby be sure to check them out:
