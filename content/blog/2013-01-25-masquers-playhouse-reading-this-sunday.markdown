title: Masquers Playhouse reading THIS Sunday
---

We have rehearsal tomorrow and I just can't wait! This Sunday night at 7pm, you don't want to miss [The Weirdness of Rachel Bublitz, Four, Vile, Grim, Hilarious Plays](https://www.facebook.com/events/442783652441810/)!

There will be some hilarious plays, I promise. Here's more info, or click the link above to get to the facebook page.

Masquers Playhouse in Pt. Richmond will be presenting four of my one act plays for their Off The Page staged reading series!

A grandmother tries to reconnect with her estranged granddaughter in hopes to bring her into the cut throat family business while a wife rejoices over the sudden and unexpected death of her husband. Elsewhere, a baby helps a mother realize all that is terrible about parenting and yet another mother eats a pie made out of people in hopes that she'll be able to re-birth her missing daughter. Yeah, they're pretty much all rotten, ugly, disgusting people. Let's laugh at them together.
