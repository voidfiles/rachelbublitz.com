title: Repro Rights! TONIGHT!
---

Tonight is the night for [Playwrights' Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/) [REPRO RIGHTS!](https://www.facebook.com/events/238167012972710/). I wasn't able to make last night's rehearsal, but I heard from the producer that the show is going to be amazing. Remember, we're raising money for [Planned Parenthood](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/), all the money raised tonight is going *directly* to them!

Here are the details for the show, in case you've forgotten:

Playwrights Center of San Francisco is sponsoring "REPRO RIGHTS," a timely, entertaining, and thought-provoking evening of staged readings of original short plays and monologues on the topic of reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. 

Our benefiting organization is Planned Parenthood.

This event is driven by Bay Area playwrights, producers, directors, actors, volunteers, sponsors, and donors.

WHY

The last two years have given rise to an alarming trend in challenges to women's reproductive rights. 

* In 2011 state legislatures introduced more than 1,100 anti-abortion provisions. 

* Seven states either fully defunded or made moves toward defunding Planned Parenthood, which provides basic health care, contraception, breast cancer, and STD screenings to millions of low-income women each year. 

* On a federal level, Republicans in Congress used abortion and Planned Parenthood funding as a bargaining chip during budget negotiations and almost shut down the government in the process. 

* Mandatory ultrasound bills were introduced that tried to narrow the definition of rape to include only "forcible rape" and barred the District of Columbia from being able to use its own locally raised funds to help low-income women pay for abortions. 

* In addition to witnessing dozens of ongoing state challenges, in what some have called a "war on women," 2012 saw a House hearing on birth control that did not include a single woman.
