title: Shows YOU Should See
---

As usual there are a lot of great theatre happening right here in the Bay Area... Want some hot tips on what to see? Excellent, it seems you came to the right place...

###[The Hundred Flowers Project](https://app.ticketturtle.com/index.php?actions=4&p=1), running from now until 11/17.

This past summer I saw a reading of The Hundred Flowers Project by [Christopher Chen](http://www.aoiagency.com/2010/06/christopher-chen-2/), with [Playwrights Foundation](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/)'s Bay Area Playwrights Festival. Let me tell you, my socks were knocked right off. And from [this review](http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/The-Hundred-Flowers-Project-review-3994022.php), and [this review](http://www.theaterdogs.net/2012/10/30/crowded-fire-please-sir-may-i-have-some-mao/), I know it's only gotten better. Tickets go up as the run goes on, so go early! I also have a feeling that theatre this exciting will sell out, so[ buy your tickets](https://app.ticketturtle.com/index.php?actions=4&p=1) ahead of time!

###[SF Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/), runs 12/5 - 12/20.

The festival includes twenty five brand new one acts from twenty seven bay area playwrights. This years theme is TITANS VS. OLYMPIANS; and each show will consist of a staged reading about each, and all shows will be at [The Exit](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=the+exit+san+francisco&sugexp=chrome,mod%3D0&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&sa=N&tab=wl&authuser=0).

###[Don Reed's THE KIPLING HOTEL](http://www.themarsh.org/don_reed.html), running from now until 12/16.

I got to meet Don Reed this past Saturday at [Play Cafe](http://www.playcafe.org/)'s panel this past Saturday. Not only did he supply us with great advice, he also had some great stories to tell. I am confident that you will enjoy this show. 

###[SUPERIOR DONUTS](https://www.facebook.com/events/294046357367594/), running 11/2 - 12/2

[Custom Made Theatre Co.](http://www.custommade.org/) is presenting the San Francisco premiere of SUPERIOR DONUTS by [Tracy Letts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Letts). The show is a comedy set in a donut shop, and if it's half as good as the last two shows I've seen from Custom Made Theatre Co. (THE PLAY ABOUT THE BABY by Edward Albee, and THE MERCHANT OF VENICE by Shakespeare) it'll be worth the effort!

Alright, you have your orders! Go see theatre! Maybe I'll see you there...
