Hooray! Another thing has become officially official enough for me to announce! My thirty minute TYA play [*MUCH ADO ABOUT MATHLETES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2547/much-ado-about-mathletes), first produced with [San Francisco State](https://theatredance.sfsu.edu/)'s Spring Fringe (directed by the wonderful human Kathleen Lee), is getting published with [Eldridge Publishing](https://www.histage.com/)!!! 

You'll be able to buy this, in real-life book form soon, so get ready to tell all the high school and middle school theater teachers you know!

Happy Friday!
