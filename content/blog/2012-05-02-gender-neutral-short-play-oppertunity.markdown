title: Gender Neutral Short Play Opportunity
---

Came across an interesting opportunity today. Papercut Theatre (located in England) is looking for short plays, 15 minutes max, on any subject and within any genre. The wish only that you not specify the genders of any of the characters. If your play is selected two different directors will direct your play for Papercut's upcoming festival.

I think this idea is incredibly interesting, and not just as a writer. I think the actors and directors will have a lot of space to play around here, and the audience will get to see two different interpretations of the same script. If I had my own theatre, I might just steal this idea!

The submission deadline is May 25th.
