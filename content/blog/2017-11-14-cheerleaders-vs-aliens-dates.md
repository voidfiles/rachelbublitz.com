The best ever is when you're more and more excited about a project as it moves closer, this is especially true for my commissioned high school play *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS* because as the production gets nearer, I get more meetings with two of my favorite gals- Jamie Wilcox, who runs the [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/about-youtheatre), and Alicia Washington, director of my show, and artistic director for [Good Theatre Company](https://www.goodcotheatre.com/) up in Ogden. So much tea guys, so many good cookies!

We met today, and talked over schedules and media plans, and design concepts, and I just want to sing and dance in the street with excitement. AND, we have official dates for the show! 

*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS* will only have FOUR shows, so be sure to watch out for tickets and when those go on sale- A little bird told me things tend to sell out *quick*. We'll open Thursday, May 10th, have a show on the evening of Friday, May 11th, and have a matinee and an evening show on Saturday, May 12th. Tickets and posters and audition information will be coming down the pipeline, and I will be posting everything here as things become official. OH MAN I CAN'T WAIT! 

This show is going to be *SO* good. Now you can plan your 2018 lives accordingly!
