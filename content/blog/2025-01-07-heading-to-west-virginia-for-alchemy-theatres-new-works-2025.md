Back in the Fall of 2023, I came across this really beautiful poster for my play [*The Book Women*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/the-book-women):

The play was being produced by [Alchemy Theatre](https://www.alchemytheatretroupe.org/), a theatre company in Huntington, West Virginia. I followed them on Instagram, and loved seeing the promotional shots they shared. I can't tell you how fun it is to see your play going up, but that's doubled when you can see the care the crew and cast and production team clearly from the other side of the country.

Fast forward to *this* past Fall, and I notice that an Alchemy Theatre is producing my sci-fi comedy [*Cheerleaders VS. Aliens*](https://www.pioneerdrama.com/SearchDetail.asp?pc=CHEERLEADE&id=0). I thought it must be a different company. There's no way that the same theatre would produce the same playwright in back-to-back seasons... so I start doing some digging. In this digging I find out that not only is it the same Alchemy Theatre that produced *The Book Women*, but it's the same director, Cindy Westbrook! I am, of course, thoroughly honored by this, and, since I'm following Alchemy on Instagram, I get to see an interview from some of the cast and crew of *Cheerleaders VS. Aliens* on a local new station! Again, the care is clear, the joy is clear, and I am downright delighted.

In fact, I am so delighted that I decide to reach out to thank them for the productions and offer to send them copies of my other published works. They let me know they'd love for me to send scripts their way. I send them a box of plays, and let them know if they'd ever want to collaborate more, I would be very interested in how that could look. In a blink Nora Ankrom, executive director of Alchemy Theatre, who I've been corresponding with, invites me out to West Virginia as a guest speaker!

Long story short: I leave for Alchemy Theatre and their [New Works 2025](https://www.alchemytheatretroupe.org/show/new-works-2025/) on Thursday morning!

I will be responding to new plays written by students and delivering a key note address! This will be my very first key note address! I feel super lucky and incredibly fancy.

Could I start out the year any better? I really don't think I could. See you soon, West Virginia!
