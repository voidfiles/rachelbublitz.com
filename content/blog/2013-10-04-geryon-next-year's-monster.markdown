title: Geryon, Next Year's Monster
---

Next year I'll be writing the one-act about Geryon for [SF Olympian Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) (November 15!). *Who* is Geryon, you might be wondering, well I will tell you... Geryon was a giant who tended cattle off on an island somewhere, minding his own business when Hercules came, stole his cattle, and killed him. It was a part of Hercules' 12 tasks (the taking the cattle, he killed Geryon just as icing on the cake I guess). A few things drew me to Geryon... First, he wasn't wreaking havoc on anyone, unlike *plenty* of other monsters who were out for blood, but not Geryon. Second, there are many descriptions of him. Some stories he is a three headed monster, others a three bodied monster on two skinny legs, others he has wings, and one that I read he has three bodies that are joined at the stomach. And third, I like that he's so mysterious, and that he isn't one of the first monsters we think of when we think of the monsters in Greek Myths. In fact, I hadn't heard of him before the call for submissions came out! 

The story that I'm planning on telling will be a modern interpretation of Geryon, taking place in a small town and involving a aging outsider and a popular youth. So, while you're counting down the days until you get to watch the staged reading of *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats*, comfort yourself with thoughts of the grotesque giant Geryon and the adventures to come for next year's festival!
