title: A New Play!
---

I was reading over [Aurora](http://auroratheatre.org/)'s [GAP](http://auroratheatre.org/index.php?option=com_theatre&view=tpage&id=82) submission requirements, and I realized that I had nothing that fit the bill! How could this be? Well, naturally my solution is to write a brand new full length before the deadline of July 15th. I just added it to my calendar, so it has to happen now. It's on.

This isn't a play that came from nowhere, I've been thinking of three technology based full-length plays for a while now, and now I have a reason to start them. I've thrown caution to the wind  and started writing. In order to turn it in before the deadline, I'm also trying to get a reading of the play done so I can make some fixes. Crazy, sure, probably, but why not, right? I don't think I'm going to get anywhere if I'm not crazy (in this way, anyway), so here we go. And really, it might not even be *that* crazy. I've been reading about "Bake Offs", where you get ingredients and a week or two to write something brand new. So this will be my own personal Bake Off. 

Mostly I'm trying to tell you that if you don't see me this month, don't worry, I'm writing.
