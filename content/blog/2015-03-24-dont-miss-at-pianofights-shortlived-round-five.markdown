title: 'Don''t Miss @PianoFight''s ShortLived Round Five! #newplay'
---

My short play *TO THE MAN WHO SANG BOWIE* has been selected to compete in [Piano Fight](http://www.pianofight.com/)'s [ShortLived](https://www.facebook.com/events/1603983919833826/): [Round 5](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/shortlived-round-5-tickets-15752296543?aff=efbevent)!

What's ShortLived, you wonder? Wonder no more. ShortLived is "the largest audience-judged theater competition in the nation!" It throws 30 plays into the ring, and after 7 weeks only one will walk out still breathing. And with a nice check!

My team is outstanding, I've got the acting talents of Meredith Terry and Andy Strong! And my director is Devin McNulty!

Round 5 takes place April 2nd-April 4th (8pm shows each night, with a bonus 5pm show on the 4th as well). You can (and should), buy your tickets here: [http://www.eventbrite.com/e/shortlived-round-5-tickets-15752296543?aff=efbevent](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/shortlived-round-5-tickets-15752296543?aff=efbevent)! Piano Fight's new space is located at [144 Taylor St in San Francisco](https://www.google.com/maps?q=144+Taylor+St+San+Francisco,+CA+94102&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS574US574&es_sm=91&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ei=79gRVcTRIYL3yQSmmoG4Bw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ). And remember, vote, vote, vote!

Also, not that I want to sway your vote, but the 5th of April is my birthday, so instead of the large elaborate present you were planning just go watch my play! And yeah, vote for it too, why not.

Woooo!
