What a week. This country is very good at breaking hearts. 

If you're looking for ways to help, I suggest checking out the [NAACP](https://naacp.org/campaigns/we-are-done-dying/?fbclid=IwAR1ETchwYabD4q9rG9H8My3vi27RkF1LB3yid2lWQ4Sfp-qQnLagGxhUrng) and [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/) websites. If you want to know more about the historic systemic racism in this country (because, honestly, I can say that MY public school education left A LOT out) read more about it: [Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow by Henry Louis Gates Jr.](https://smile.amazon.com/Stony-Road-Reconstruction-White-Supremacy/dp/0525559531/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=stony+the+road&qid=1591033765&sr=8-1) and/or [Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates](https://smile.amazon.com/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0812993543/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Between+the+World+and+Me&qid=1591033848&sr=8-1).

This is hard and terrible and messy and I think to move forward we have to be willing to act, knowing that we will make mistakes, and that we must pay attention all along the way to learn from those mistakes. I am not perfect. I have SO much to learn. I still have to catch myself, to check my own biases. Donate if you can, listen, learn. Try.
