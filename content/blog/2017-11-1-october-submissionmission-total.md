It's November! Only TWO more months in the year, which means only TWO months left to reach my submission mission of 400 submissions for the year. How did I do in October, you wonder? Well, quite frankly, I *murdered* October by sending out FORTY TWO submissions! Adding my October total to all the other months of the year so far, I'm up to 368! Which means, not only am I ahead of schedule to reach my goal, but I've already surpassed my record from when I submitted [366 times in 2014](http://rachelbublitz.alexkessinger.net/blog/2015/01/05/2014-submission-mission/). 

BOOM GUYS! Boom.

Hey 400, I am coming AT YOU!
