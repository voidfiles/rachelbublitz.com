My summer-camp monster comedy, [*The Summer I Howled*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/the-summer-i-howled-by-rachel-bublitz-690), is getting a European Premiere with [Mr Sands Youth Theatre](https://www.mrsandsyouththeatre.ie/) in Bray, Ireland!! This will be my second Irish production, [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches) was produced by [Droichead Youth Theatre](https://droicheadyouththeatre.wordpress.com/) in Drogheda, Ireland a few years ago in 2023. I am thrilled for my work to be back in Ireland, and I hope this is a trend that takes hold, then maybe I'll even make way out to Ireland along with my words! Here's a pull-quote from the play and a synopsis:

>"You don’t know how you didn’t see it? Probably because you didn’t think werewolves were real. Because I didn’t either… This is. Bonkers. Bananas! I’m just. I’m a kid at camp! I’m boring. I write bad poetry and want my acne to go away. I’m not. I can’t be…"  

>Another summer at Camp Gray Pine kicks off, and the Bunk 13 crew plan on it being their best summer yet! But on the first night of camp, one of the crew gets attacked by a wild animal in the woods, and starts to undergo some unnerving changes. On top of that, campers are going missing, and when they turn up, they’re not quite themselves anymore.  

>As the moon waxes and wanes, Bunk 13 begin to realize they might be trapped in the middle of a conflict of supernatural proportions…
