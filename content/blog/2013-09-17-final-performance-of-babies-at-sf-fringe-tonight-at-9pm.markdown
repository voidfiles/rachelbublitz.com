title: Final Performance of BABIES at SF Fringe Tonight @ 9pm!
---

Okay folks, it all comes down to this... If you haven't had a chance to see [BABIES, The Ultimate Birth Control](https://www.facebook.com/events/158170084370589/), tonight is your last chance! Tonight, 9pm at the Exit, or fantastic actors take the stage for the last time! You don't want to miss this adorable/terrifying set of plays that will make you want to run off and buy all the condoms Costco keeps in stock. Seriously, it's funny stuff.

And you don't have to take my word for it, we have TWO more reviews! Lisa says:

>"There are gems in this mix. Weave that precocious truth-telling “Baby” and his mama into a full-length play ASAP."

And Patrick M Brennan says:

>"I could relate to all of these plays. I laughed a lot. I cried a little. I enjoyed myself a lot. Definitely worth seeing! If you’ve ever had a baby, or wanted to have a baby, or were ever a baby, you’ll love this."
