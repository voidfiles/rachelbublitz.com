title: All My Loud and Unladylike Fears
---

Maybe you don't know. Maybe you live under a rock, and today you just happen to get out from under your comfy rock, and you see that a festival that I started opens up today. That could be true. But, let's be honest, I've been blasting this show around the web so much that you're probably like, "Okay, yeah, Rachel, I get it." Well, I don't get it. And that's why I have to tell you again, [DIVAfest](http://divafest.info/)'s Loud & Unladylike Festival opens TONIGHT! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! For reals. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

Don't get me wrong, I'm excited for the show, and I can't wait to share it with ALL the people, but really. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Here are my fears in no specific order:

1. What if no one comes? PS, this is a GREAT time to buy your tickets: [http://divafest.info/](http://divafest.info/).
2. What if NO ONE COMES? Yeah, this is such a big fear, it gets the #1 and #2 spot.
3. What if I was wrong? I'm not sure what about, maybe about the festival, maybe about my life choices. Either way, there's a chance that I'm wrong.
4. What if no one comes? 
5. What if people walk out?
6. What if people throw things at Claire, Tracy, and me?
7. What if the theater catches fire?
8. WHAT IF NO ONE COMES?
9. What if I can't leave the house because my son, who has the flu, gives it to my daughter and my husband, and I'm the only not sick one left and I have to stay and take care of them. Am I a bad playwright for this? Am I a bad mother if I don't?
10. What if I can't leave the house because my son, who has the flu, gives it to ME. Will I be a terrible person and risk infecting the world and go anyway? HOW CAN I NOT GO?
11. What if there's traffic and all the people who want to be there can't get there in time?
12. What if there's traffic and I'm late?
13. What if no one comes?
14. What if NO ONE understands my play? My play is, and I hate to use this term, but it's experimental. At least for me, it is. It has like 20 characters all played by an ensemble of 6. There's Spanish, French, and German in the play. THERE'S NO PLOT. Yeah, there is PURPOSELY no plot. 
15. What if no one is there to not understand my play?
16. What if my play doesn't do Nancy Wake justice?
17. What if her ghost HATES the play and she haunts me the rest of my life for it?
18. Is it supposed to be CODENAME or CODE NAME? Am I doing it wrong???
19. WHAT IF NO ONE COMES?
20. What if the city runs out of milkshakes? WHAT WILL WE DRINK AFTER THE SHOW?

Oddly, I feel a lot better. So thanks. For listening.
