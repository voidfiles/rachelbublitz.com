title: 11 Days To Get Your Scripts In For SF BOA!
---

The [Bay Area One Acts Festival](http://bayoneacts.org/) is one of my favorite theatre festivals. I was blown away by [BOA 2012](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2012/05/10/things-i-learned-at-boa-program-1/) and I can't wait for this year's festival. Want to be a part of it? If your'e a local playwright, I strongly suggest you get your scripts to them before 12/15! You must be from the Bay Area, the script has to be less than 30 pages, and all you need to do is email them a copy. For more details, see their [submission guideline's](http://bayoneacts.org/submissions/).

Well? What are you waiting for?
