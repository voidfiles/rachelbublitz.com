title: I Did The Damn Thing
---

That's right, I took the problems in THE FANTASY CLUB and (hopefully) kicked them to the curb. I feel pretty good about things tonight. We'll see how things are looking in the cold light of morning. It's days like this that I desperately wish I had a secret room in my house dedicated to store talented actors that I could pull out at a moments notice and they would read for me. Too bad that's extremely illegal and probably not very cost affective. Sigh. Guess I'll have to wait for scene nights.
