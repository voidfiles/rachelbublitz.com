title: 2014 Goal
---

I have just one goal this year. In 2014 I plan on submitting 365 plays. That's a play for each day in 2014. So far I'm already behind, as I've submitted zip in the past six days, but I am confident that I'll be able to catch up.

Want to see how I'm doing? The last day of each month I'll post my numbers so you can see how I'm doing in the challenge. 

Do you have theater related goals for 2014? If so, please share! I'd love to hear how other folks plan on challenging themselves in the coming year.
