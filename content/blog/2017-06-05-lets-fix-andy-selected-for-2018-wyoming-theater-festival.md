Mark your calendars for 2018, yes the entire year because I don't have the specific dates yet, *LET'S FIX ANDY* will be in the 2018 [Wyoming Theater Festival](wyomingtheaterfestival.com)! Not a reading either, like it's slated to be this year, or *RIPPED* was last year, it's in for a workshop production! Eeeeeeeeee!

That means I'll get to work with a director and cast for two-ish weeks, get the play up on its feet, and put it in front of an audience for the first time. Artistic Director DannyLee Hodnett calls it "lightly produced." This is extremely exciting as it'll give me a chance to tinker and see how the play is working in the rehearsal room AND in front of an audience right away. PLUS the festival invites theater professionals from around the country to come out, in hopes to push plays through to their world premiere. 

So mark all of 2018 off, I'll get back to you when I can about specific dates. And keep looking here for announcements about actors, a director, and all that good stuff. 

Eeeeeeeeeee!
