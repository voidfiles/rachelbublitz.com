I have a new play! Well, I've had it since October of last year, but I have a new draft of this new play, one that I am *pumped* about. *BURST* is my first full-length to be told in one scene (and in real-time). It also has three characters, one of whom is an amazing anti-hero making me only want to write characters like her from now until forever, and not that this is a *woman's* play, but all three of the characters are in fact women (a joke that will make so much more sense to you after you read the play). Here's a bit more about *BURST*:

>"On the brink of her next round of funding, Sarah Boyd, Founder and CEO of Tactix, must hold her company together through a pesky journalist's questions and glaring doubts thrown her way surrounding the promises her company has made. It's a heavy load, and Sarah knows that she is the only one great enough to bear it."

I'm sending it out *all* over the play, trying to get it polished up for the big Fall submission season, and I could use both eyes and notes on it, AND/OR a reading. If any of the above sounded interesting to you, you can help me....

1. [Read *BURST* on the New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) and if you like it, give it a recommendation! If you did't like it, [email me](mailto:Rnbublitz@gmail.com) with your thoughts!
2. If you have a theater or just a lot of moxie, help me put together a reading of this bad boy in front of an audience! I'd love to get at least *one* in before or near September to really get it up to snuff for submission season. Please [email me](mailto:Rnbublitz@gmail.com) if this is something you'd be interested in!

Okay folks, back to kid-summering.... My eight year old son is currently making pancakes by himself for the first time and I fear the kitchen will never be the same... 

Happy Tuesday!
