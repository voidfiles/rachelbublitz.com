title: Playwriting Cage Match
---

I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that a short play cage match is the best idea ever. That's what I'm thinking. The good ol' folks over at THe Douglas Morrisson Theatre in Hayward are doing just that. That's right, you heard me... It's a short play cage match! Intrigued? Submit a short play! There's a $50 prize! Click [here](http://dmtonline.org/Playwriting.htm) for the rules and regulations, the deadline is June 18, 2012. Do it!!
