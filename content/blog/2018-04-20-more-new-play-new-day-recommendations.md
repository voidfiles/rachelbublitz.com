As  much as I want that [National New Play Network](http://nnpn.org/) button, I have to say, reading all of these new plays has been one of the most fun things ever. This week I've discovered new playwrights I never heard of before and have completely fallen in love with their work. I know that I won't always be able to keep up this break-neck pace of reading and recommending new plays on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard), but I'll have to figure out a way to fit it in my schedule because THIS IS SO MUCH FUN! Here are my play recommendations from this week:
