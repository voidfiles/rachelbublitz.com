*HUGE* announcement: I WROTE A FREAKING BOOK!!!!!

I have been working on {{< rawhtml >}}
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Build a Playwright in Three Acts</span>
{{< /rawhtml >}}, published through [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/), for years. Turns out books have a lot more words in them than plays!

This whole wild idea started with my experience teaching playwriting and wanting to find scenes that I could use to break down single dramatic tools, which was always harder than I thought it should be. I had decided to just start writing my own, right when I happened to have a meeting with Stage Partners. On a lark, I pitched these scenes as the seeds for a book on playwriting. And they said yes! Which was super amazing, but then I had to figure out how to write an actual book!

It is the hardest writing project to date I've ever taken on. But, if you know me you know that I do love a challenge. And now that I'm on the other side of it, I can say it was well worth my years of effort. I am so proud, and I can't wait to share this book with the world!

The book, in three acts, walks playwrights of all levels through basic dramatic tools (act one), elements of plays (act two), and developing craft (act three). It is going to the printer as we speak, and will have a link for where you can purchase yourself a copy in the new year. So check back!!!

Happy Monday!
