title: Recap; The Weirdness of Rachel Bublitz
---

Last night [Masquers Playhouse](http://www.masquers.org/) presented staged readings of four of my short plays for their [Off The Page](http://www.masquers.org/?page_id=203) series. It was a great delight to hear my plays read by the talented group actors that [Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2), my director, put together. My actors were, Jan Carty Marsh, [Allison Page](https://twitter.com/AllisonLynnPage), Abigail Edber, Beth Chastain, Elgin Jackson and Tavis Kammet. 

I loved sitting in the back watching the audience crack during the reading. My husband could barely breath because he was laughing so hard while Allison and Tavis read *Nap Time*. But, more important than enjoying my work, I got the chance to improve my work. I tightened up both *Nap Time* and *Horny Like The Wolf*, and I rewrote *Baby Pie*. I alsoIthink I finally understand the problems within *Terrible People* after hearing it last night. 

Overall, it was a great experience, I highly recommend submitting for Off The Page, the folks at Masquers Playhouse are really great to work with.
