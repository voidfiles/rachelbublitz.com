Attention all high school playwrights, [PlayGround](http://playground-sf.org/index.php) has extended the deadline for their [Young Playwrights Contest](http://playground-sf.org/youngplaywrights/) to April 14th! 

From PlayGround's website:

>"The following are the guidelines for script submissions for PlayGround’s 2014 Young Playwrights Contest. To be eligible, writers must currently attend high school in one of the nine Bay Area counties.

>Topic: ‘All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players; 
They have their exits and their entrances; 
And one man in his time plays many parts…’
- from Shakespeare's As You Like It"
