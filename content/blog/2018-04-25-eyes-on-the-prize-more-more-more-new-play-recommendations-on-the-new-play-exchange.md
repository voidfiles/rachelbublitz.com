title = "Eyes On The Prize: More More More New Play Recommendations On The New Play Exchange"

+++

I was reading and recommending plays last night, and my husband asked me if the button from the [National New Play Network](http://nnpn.org/) was a little emblem that would go on our [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) profile, and when I corrected him and let him know it was an actual *physical* button, he responded: "Ooooh, like a medal!" And now I want it even more! So I've kicked it into a higher gear and have been reading, reading, reading my mornings and evenings away, and writing, writing, writing recommendations for all that I enjoy.

Here's what I've recommended so far this week:

* ["*Self Promoted*" by Jessica Austgen](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/126533/self-promoted)
* ["*Apollo Flies*" by Jessica Austgen](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/170090/apollo-flies)
* ["*#yesmeansyes*" by Carol Lashof](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/16369/yesmeansyes)
* ["*Tinder... Sucka*" by Inda Craig-Galv√°n](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/154957/tinder-sucka)
* ["*The Heartbreakers*" by Iraisa Ann Reilly](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/132085/heartbreakers)

* ["*Chekhov's Date (10 min)*" by Cassandra Rose](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/55147/chekhovs-date-10-min)

* ["*[IN JUST-] A WHISTLE*" by Callan Stout](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138206/just-whistle)

Discovering all these different voices and artists has been a secret prize in this month long reading challenge. And with only *five* days left, I can't wait to see who else I read and fall in love with.

Yay reading new plays!
