title: 181 Submissions So Far In 2013
---

I inch closer and closer to my goal of 100 rejection letters during 2013, but I fear that I will not reach it by December 31st! This goal was 100% stolen from the inspirational/fabulous/phenomenally talented and intelligent Megan Cohen! You should check out her website so that you can start stealing from her as well: [http://plays.megancohen.com/](http://plays.megancohen.com/).

Right now I have a total 181 submissions with 85 rejections (15 to go!), 13 acceptances, and 83 I am still waiting to find out about, for a total of 181 submissions this year! Looking at that number, I'm thinking of challenging myself a bit in the last few weeks of the year and trying to get another 19 plays submitted to bring my total up to 200! Wish me luck!

I think getting 15 more rejection letters before the end of the year is a bit of a stretch sadly, more often than not you don't hear anything ever. But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying.

I'm thinking that next year I need to set some seriously high submission goals in order to hit the 100 rejection letters I'm hoping for, I'll start getting the stamps ready now I think.
