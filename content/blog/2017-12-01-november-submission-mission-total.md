Slightly anti-climatic, as I'm in the middle of my last-ten-submission countdown, but let's tabulate and calculate and add up all those tally marks (yes, that's my super scientific method for adding up my submissions) for my November #SubmissionMission total!.....

For the month of November I sent out 29 total submissions!! Just one shy of one per day, but adding that to my submissions for the rest of the year, I'm up to 397, as [noted yesterday in my countdown post](https://rachelbublitz.com/2017/11/30/submission-mission-countdown-submission-397/).

THREE TO GO! THREE! 

Will I make it? Um, I'm betting on yes. Now I'm wondering how much *past* 400 submissions I can hit. But, for the last month of the year, I've got a pretty full plate, so we'll have to wait and see... I've got two plays that need new drafts (*BURST* and *HAPPILY*), a whole brand new play to crank out ([my final play of my six play plan for 2017!](http://rachelbublitz.com/2017/01/03/six-play-plan-for-2017/)), and all the grading and teaching stuff I have to do too.... I'll need to stay very hydrated. 

Happy December folks!
