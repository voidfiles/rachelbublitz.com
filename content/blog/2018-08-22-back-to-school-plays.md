School is either back or almost back in session for most folks around the country, so I thought this would be a *perfect* time to highlight all the scripts I have available for young performers! If you're a theater educator, or just looking for new theatrical material in general, be sure and check these plays out:

## Elementary School And Up:

### [*NO TALKING ALLOWED!*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/no-talking-allowed-by-rachel-bublitz-505&ref=search.php%3Fquicksearchbox%3Dno%2Btalking%2Ballowed), ten - fifteen minutes

Synopsis: Jordan gets kicked out of class for talking. But a zero on the test may be the least of Jordan’s problems when a pencil starts to talk—and then a locker and a mop and a slew of other inanimate objects. Maybe Jordan’s going crazy, but Jordan’s not the only one, as soon a hall monitor, the custodian, a teacher and the principal join in as they try to get to the bottom of all the yammering in this comedy inspired by an African folk tale.

Cast: 6-12 performers of any gender.

Synopsis: Farmer comes across a beautiful golden mortar and decides to present it to the King as a gift, despite his daughter Catherine’s warnings that the King will ask for a golden pestle to match. When the King learns of Catherine's uncanny predictions, it launches a series of riddles going back and forth between the two of them culminating in a royal marriage proposal for the clever girl. But if you marry a clever girl, you get a clever queen, and Catherine cannot help but meddle in the affairs of state. Now Catherine must use all her wits to save her marriage and prove to the King that he needs her to help him run the kingdom.

## Middle School And Up:

### [*MUCH ADO ABOUT MATHLETES*](https://histage.com/much-ado-about-mathletes), twenty five - thirty minutes

Synopsis: High school senior Kimberly is the founder and president of the school’s undefeated all-girl math team. She expects nothing but the best from her mathletes, especially since it’s her senior year and her last opportunity to compete and secure her legacy. Unfortunately, things don’t always go as planned. One of their members is suddenly forced to sit out the rest of the season, so their first alternate — Monica H. — must step up and compete even though she longs desperately to join the drama club instead. A possible solution presents itself when Mr. Roberts tries to put Jared on the team, but the other girls aren’t on board… after all, this was supposed to be an all-girls team. They debate, argue, and ponder (sometimes in Shakespearean-style verse), as they try to find a solution all of them can live with.

Cast: 6 F, 2 M.

## College:

It's tricky sometimes to find age-appropriate work for acting classes and productions.
