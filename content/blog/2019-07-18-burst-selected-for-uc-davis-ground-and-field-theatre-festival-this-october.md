[*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) has been selected for a workshop production with the UC Davis Department of Theatre and Dance and the Theatre & Dance Ensemble's [Ground & Field Theatre Festival](https://www.groundandfield.com/) coming up this September and October! Which means I will be headed back to California this Fall to develop *BURST*, a play that is picking up a lot of attention. *BURST* was a semi-finalist three times this year, had three readings last year, and this will be the second workshop of *BURST* in six months! I've been getting many requests to use *BURST* in auditions, and even a few production nibbles. If you're in the area, please join me in Davis October 1-5th and see what all the fuss is about!

I'll have exact dates and times soon, for now here are my directors and cast:

*BURST* by Rachel Bublitz  
Co-Directed by Tom Burmester & Danika Sudik  
Ground & Field Theatre Festival  
Presented by UC Davis Department of Theatre and Dance and the Theatre & Dance Ensemble

Sarah Boyd--Jennifer Grace  
Jennifer Weaver--Danielle Levin  
Alexis Lyons--Aubrey Schoeman  

More coming soon! In the mean time please give *BURST* a read on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst).
