title: Pre-Order Your Best of PlayGround 19 Anthology!
---

On sale now, the [Best of PlayGround 19 Anthology](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/best-of-playground-san-francisco-2015-book/x/3022863) including new plays by Genne Murphy, Erin Marie Panttaja, Kirk Shimano, Steven Westdahl, Davern Wright, and me! For the dedicated theater enthusiasts among you, I'd recommend the deal where you get 5 copies of the book for $60. Give the other 4 away to your best friends, or make small book forts for your puppets! It's really a win-win.

Here's that link: [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/best-of-playground-san-francisco-2015-book/x/3022863](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/best-of-playground-san-francisco-2015-book/x/3022863)
