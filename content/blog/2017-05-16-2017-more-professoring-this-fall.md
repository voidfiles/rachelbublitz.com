I just agreed to teach TWO classes this Fall up at [Weber State University](http://www.weber.edu/)! So this professor experiment will continue. I'll be teaching an online Introduction To Theater class, and an Introduction To Acting class! That's twice the class I had this past semester, but since I'll have a wealth of time to prepare at this moment I feel pretty optimistic. Come late August, I'll probably be freaking out, but for now I'm pumped. I guess I'm officially an adjunct professor now. Fancy fancy!
