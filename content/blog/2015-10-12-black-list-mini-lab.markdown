title: Black List Mini Lab
---

Huge exciting news! I have been selected to workshop my screenplay, GIRL FRIEND, in a [Black List Mini Lab](https://blcklst.com/help/article/437)! I know what you're probably thinking, WHAT? I was thinking the same thing, I'll explain...

The summer before last, 2014, I wrote my first screenplay in my very first screen writing class. I've worked on and tweaked it over the past year and am working on it again this semester in my current screen writing class. My teacher had the opportunity to nominate students to participate in a workshop, I was nominated, I raced around to get all the material written and collected, and then I was picked! Now you're probably wondering what the [Black List](https://blcklst.com/) actually is, well, they're this:

And now you're wondering what we do at a mini-lab? Well at this lab I will be going back and forth between peer review sessions and 2 hour mentor sessions to whip my screenplay into shape. I am both extremely excited and completely freaking out. Don't tell them this, but I have only written the ONE screen play and have never actually made a film before. But I'm also very proud and ready to be immersed in this brand new medium. 

Oh, AND IT'S THIS WEEKEND. It starts Friday and runs until Sunday night. While this is an incredible opportunity that I'm very excited to jump on, it wouldn't be possible without my kick-ass husband and friends who are stepping up to help with the kids so I can basically be done this entire weekend. SO, THANK YOU!

Here are the other lucky folks that are attending the lab:

Sarah Archer Moulton, "Michael and the Mansion of Pleasure"

Elizabeth Oyebode, "Sexton"

Rachel Bublitz, "Girl Friend"

Joe Rechtman, "The Encampment"

This script is very near and dear to my heart and I feel a tremendous urgency that this is a story that needs to be told now. I can't wait to hear all about how to do that better. For those of you who are curious here's the log-line for GIRL FRIEND (check me out, using the lingo):

>Eleanor, who is still in the kissing is gross camp, must stop her best friend from falling in love with her before he ruins their relationship, while learning to play the drums so their band can win all that talent show contest cash and she can finally stop being the only kid in high school without a cell phone.

Wish me luck! Wish me the ability to still stay on top of my homework! AHHHHH! I still can't believe this is happening. I'm 90% smiles right now.
