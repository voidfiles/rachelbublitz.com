title: Leaving For The KCACTF Region 7 Conference Tomorrow!
---

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Leaving *bright* and early tomorrow for a week long theater conference up in Washington State! So excited! And also a little sleepy in anticipation from waking up tomorrow at 4am for my flight. This will be my first time this long away from my kids AND the first time I'll be traveling for theater. My ten-minute play *MOM'S HAM* is a semi-finalist for best ten-minute play and it will be presented at the conference! If it moves to the next round I'll get to go to Washington DC for the April conference. Weeeee!

I'll try to post pictures and updates as the week progresses, but I'm not sure how the week will go as far as free time is concerned. If I can't post during, there will be a summary at the end so stay tuned for more!
