Last night was the "White Council" meeting for the [San Francisco Olympians Festival V](sfolympians.com): [The Monster Ball](https://www.facebook.com/events/464860963653893/). All the writers and directors in one room going over festival details, sharing food, drink, and pages from the new plays. Festival VI kicks off on November 1st with the opening night party to be held at [The Exit](http://www.theexit.org/). And then THREE solid weeks of brand new plays!

Amazing, isn't it? I think so.

28 new plays, yep TWENTY EIGHT, brand-spanking-new plays, will have their first public reading during those three weeks (November 5 - 22), and let me tell you, after hearing bits of everyone's work last night, this is not going to be a year you can miss. So drop everything you have going on in November, and move to the Exit. You will not regret it.

Auditions will be this Sunday and Monday (woo!), and with actors we will have the final piece to the artistic puzzle that makes up the festival. So stay tuned folks! As soon as I have an official cast, I will yell it from the rooftops... And post about it here.

My play based on Geryon, *The Red House Monster* will go head-to-head in a fight to the death with the talented Veronica Tjioe's play based on the Minotaur. That match is November 15th at 8pm, be there or risk not knowing who would win in a fight, the Minotaur or Geryon, a three-bodied, winged, red giant.

And that's not all! Visit the facebook event page for all the other terrific shows happening in those three weeks: [www.facebook.com/events/464860963653893/](https://www.facebook.com/events/464860963653893/).

And get ready! November is coming faster than you think.
