Excited to announce that [*Red Days*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2010250/red-days) is getting another production! *Red Days* will have four performances with Southwestern Michigan College's inaugural play in the SMC BlackBox Series. Here's more about the play:

>*As the air quality in Salt Lake climbs to crisis levels, we follow Dianna through four seasons, trying to balance school, her running team, and pursuing her passion. But as she nears the end of her senior year, she's forced to decide if her running dream truly belongs to her, or if it's more her mother's, while around her the serious effects of the air quality wreak havoc on those athletes who dare breathe hard in the open air.*

*Red Days* is one of my most recommended full-length plays on the New Play Exchange, and I'm so happy that it has found an opportunity with a college! I think this play could do great things at colleges across the country.

*Red Days* runs November 20-22 at 7:30, and November 23 at 2:30 at [Southwestern Michigan College](google.com/maps/place/Southwestern+Michigan+College/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xee64055ab6bff511?sa=X&ved=1t:2428&ictx=111).

It's the last day of September, time for the spookiest month of them all.
