Thank you Pioneer Drama for this huge honor. And thank you again and again and again to Jamie Wilcox, artistic director of the [Egyptian YouTheatre](https://egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) for commissioning new work for me, and giving me space to develop it. It's a playwrights dream come true!
