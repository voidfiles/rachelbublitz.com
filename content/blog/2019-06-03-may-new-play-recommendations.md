Our May days are over, hello June! I recommended four outstanding full-length plays over the last month on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard), and I think you should check them out as well.....

[*Priapus Pie: An American Tragedy* by Stacey Rose](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/167368/priapus-pie-american-tragedy)  
[*Sweetheart Come* by Melissa Leilani Larson](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/62069/sweetheart-come)  
[*Hyannis* by Kari Bentley-Quinn](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/201627/hyannis)  
[*The Last Ring* by Ashley Lauren Rogers](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/142524/last-ring)  

All the plays I recommended this month also went toward my [52 Plays By Women](https://twitter.com/52playsbywomen) goal for the year, where I see or read one play per week by a woman! I highly recommend searching #52playsbywomen on Twitter to check out all the people participating, and to check out all those plays!

If you're looking for something to see to get your challenge going, and you're in the Bay Area, go see [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) playing now through June 15th at [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow). And use code LUCY to save $5 on your tickets! I've gotten a ton of great response from everyone who's made it out.

Happy June, everyone!
