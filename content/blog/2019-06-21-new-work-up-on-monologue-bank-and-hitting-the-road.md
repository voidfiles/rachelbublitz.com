Hey hey! I've got three more monologues up on [MonologueBank](https://www.monologuebank.com/rachel-bublitz.html), bringing my total of available monologues up to nine! As of this week you're able to download [*BLUE*](https://www.monologuebank.com/blue-blue.html), [*THE RED TRUCK*](https://www.monologuebank.com/the-red-truck-young-woman.html), and, one monologue from my recently premiered play, [*RIPPED*](https://www.monologuebank.com/ripped-lucy.html).

So, if you are an actor looking for new material to audition with, be sure to check these out on MonologueBank! And feel free to use discount code [BUBLITZ50](https://www.monologuebank.com/rachel-bublitz.html) for half-off any purchase you make of my work (good for two purchases).

In other news, non-play/theater related news, I am hitting the road! I leave today for a two-ish week road trip with my family. Which means today through July 8th I may be hard to reach... If you email or message me, be patient with my replies please!

Happy Friday!
