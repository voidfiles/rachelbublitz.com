It's 2024! Wow wow wow!

My blog has been broken since October, but we're back in business! Just in time to look back at playwriting highlights from the last year. To say that I was busy, would be an understatement. I took on more commissions than I ever had before, and a super huge (and super secret) project that took up most of my year. Never fear, I'm thisclose to announcing this super huge and secret project, stay get ready for that!

But back to the task at hand.... 2023 in playwriting:

![Collage of 2023 playwriting moments.](/images/2023_Playwriting.jpg)

### First column:  
Top: *Burst* is getting published! With Dramatic Publishing, home of my other play [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches). Be sure to keep an eye out for when *Burst* is available, should be in 2024!  

Middle: In other publishing news, [*The Summer I Howled*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/the-summer-i-howled-by-rachel-bublitz-690&ref=search.php%3Fquicksearchbox%3Dsummer) was published with YouthPLAYS, and the script is now available to purchase and license! This full-length monster comedy is a hoot and a half, and I can't wait for young actors to get their hands on it.  

Bottom: On one of my trips out to New York City I went to the Drama Book Shop and autographed copies of [*Ripped*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/ripped) and [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches)!

### Second column:  
Top: Rowland Hall commissioned a new play from me about the Great Salt Lake. I wrote *The Great Salt Film* which was produced last May and is now being considered for publication.  

Middle: [*Ripped*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/ripped) received its third production, this time in my home town of San Diego with Loud Fridge Theatre Group.  

Bottom: A monologue from *Burst* was selected for publication in [The Best Women's State Monologues 2023](https://www.amazon.com.au/Best-Womens-Stage-Monologues-2023/dp/1575259745), which you can purchase! Like, right now! Really, it's on Amazon, check it out!  

### Third column:  
Top: [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://nnpn.org/events/57cepsmdc2s9rj2ddf8aa312xwmjjb) received its first of three World Premiere Productions with Mile Square Theatre in it's National New Play Network's Rolling World Premiere! This is something I've been trying to make happen for years, and I'm so thrilled to have finally pulled it off. That I did with this specific play is just icing on the cake!  

Middle: I made my debut in Ireland with a production of [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches) this past Spring.  

### Fourth column:

This prom murder mystery is ready to make you laugh out loud and scratch your head wondering who done it. [Click on through](https://www.brookpub.com/default.aspx?pg=sd&p=34980) to pick up a script and license the play!  

Middle: *Presenting: Super Cat & Reptile Robot in the Tremendous Tickle Trouble* received a tour with Tampa's Creative Arts Theatre Company. Next up for this play is a production with the Birmingham Children's Theatre in 2024. This play is also out for consideration for publication.  

Bottom: The incredible and amazing and hilarious and heartbreaking production of [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2023/11/new-play-funny-like-an-abortion-is-dystopia-too-close-to-home-on-nj-stage-review.html) at Mile Square Theatre, where everyone gave 100% and then some. I was a very honored playwright and I am thrilled I get to see it done again and then again!
