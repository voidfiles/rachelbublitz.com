title: 'Tonight Only: Staged Reading of AUDREY SCARE PEOPLE PLAY'
---

The moment we've all been waiting for is finally here... Audrey Kessinger's breaking onto the theatre scene with a staged reading of her play *Audrey Scare People Play*. It's going to be fantastic. If you didn't know already, Audrey is my 5 year old daughter and she wrote a play this past March called *Audrey Scare People Play*. It blew up on the interwebs (seriously, it showed up on [boingboing](http://boingboing.net/2013/03/02/horrorsf-play-by-a-four-year.html)), and tonight the lovely people at [San Francisco Theater Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/) decided to include it in their evening [Pub From Another World](https://www.facebook.com/events/440212602739603/?fref=ts)! 

It all gets going at 8pm at [Cafe Royale](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=800+Post+Street,+San+Francisco&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x808580917ef615fd:0x99365b2d426d7be1,800+Post+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94109&gl=us&ei=ZYOaUf_oFc_qiwKIyYG4BQ&ved=0CC8Q8gEwAA) in San Francisco. Show up early, because I'm 99% sure it'll be packed.

If you want a taste of the play before tonight, you can [read it here](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2013/03/01/audrey-scare-people-play/).
