Coming up in a few weeks, [*Red Days*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2010250/red-days) is getting a staged reading with [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu/calendar/?id=92522)! *Red Days* received its world premiere last summer with  [Adjusted Realists](https://www.adjustedrealists.com/red-days.html) in New York City. I'm excited to have more interest in this play, and I hope to build on this momentum! It is my most recommended play on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz), with a whopping 50 recommendations!! Curious about the play? Here's the synopsis:

>"*As the air quality in Salt Lake climbs to crisis levels, we follow Dianna through four seasons, trying to balance school, her running team, and pursuing her passion. But as she nears the end of her senior year, she's forced to decide if her running dream truly belongs to her, or if it's more her mother's, while around her the serious effects of the air quality wreak havoc on those athletes who dare breathe hard in the open air.*"

You can read [*Red Days* on the New Play Exchange here](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2010250/red-days), or you can head out to Utah State University and hear it live on stage! Tickets are free! Here's the specifics:
