Home again, home again! I was out in the big wide world last week for a workshop production of [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) in Davis, California, and what a fantastic experience it was! This was [Ground & Field Theatre Festival](https://www.groundandfield.com/)'s third year, a product of UC Davis' Department of Theatre and Dance, and Ensemble Theatre & Dance. Centered on sustainability as well as environmental and/or social issues and themes, the Ground & Field Theatre Festival is a few months worth of workshops, rehearsals, readings, and performances. It was wonderful to be surrounded in theater for a week, in the making of and the seeing. Chats and connections made with new potential collaborators was also great. You know what else? Davis has really delicious Thai food. So, pretty much an amazing time all around.

The other works being fully realized on the stage for the 2019 Ground & Field Theatre Festival included:

*RANKED, A NEW MUSICAL*  
original book by Kyle Holms  
music and lyrics by David Taylor Gomes  
directed and choreographed by Mindy Cooper

*FAT KID RULES THE WORLD*  
conceived and directed by Marc Eardley  
book and lyrics by Jay Falzone  
music by Matt Gumley  
based on the novel by K.L. Going

*SUSTAIN ME*  
by Sarah Vander Schaaff  
directed by Danika Sudik

And of course....

*BURST*  
by Rachel Bublitz (ME!)  
directed by Danika Sudik

My cast, Danielle Levin (Jennifer Weaver), Jennifer Grace (Sarah Boyd), and Aubrey Schoeman (Alexis Lyons), and my brilliant director, gave me so much to think about and tinker with in developing the play further. But maybe the most exciting part was being in the audience as they experienced revelations and discoveries. Little things I planted in the opening ten minutes that hit hard in the final ten. It was very exciting. I'm also excited to see where *BURST* moves on from here! I'm in talks about this play with a few places, so keep your ears out for news, and your fingers crossed for good luck.

If you're out looking for a three person powerhouse of a play with simple production needs, check [*BURST* out on the New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst), or [email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) for a perusal copy of the script!

AND if you're reading all this thinking you might want to get involved with [Ground & Field](https://www.groundandfield.com/), check them out! They take submissions in the late winter/early spring and I highly recommend attending this annual festival.
