I'm diving into my play about Achilles, and doing some major editing. This is the most fun part, by the way. I'm also filling in a lot of the blanks, particularly the cheers from the cheerleader chorus. I have a bunch of "classic" cheers that I'm altering with Iliad flavor. It's slow going, but great fun. Want an example? Of course you do...

I found this cheer:

>"Stronger than steel

>Hotter than the sun;

>(Player name) won't stop,

>'til he gets the job done!"

And came up with this:

>"Blacker than night,

>Toxic and full of hate;

>Achilles' rage won't end,

>'til his love is taken by fate."
