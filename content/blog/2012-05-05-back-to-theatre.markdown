I've been posting about some big ideas lately. This is a post telling you what's going, and some suggestions for show to see.

###Bay Area One Acts!

The BOA festival is going strong. It opened last weekend, and runs through Saturday May 12th. There are two different programs to see, and all of the plays are by local playwrights. Go [here](https://www.ticketturtle.com/index.php?calendar=boa) for their schedule, and [here](https://www.ticketturtle.com/index.php?ticketing=boa) for tickets.

###Tenderloin at Cutting Ball

The Cutting Ball Theater has a very exciting project called "Tenderloin" playing right now. It's a documentary style play, and they've offered a lot of free and discounted tickets to the people who live in the Tenderloin. Click [here](https://cuttingball.secure.force.com/ticket#details_a0SU0000000Lo6OMAS) for tickets.

###Sheherezade XII

And finally, because it's featuring a play of mine (my first production!) you should get your tickets now! The show is a benefit for The Playwright's Center and is being produced by Wily West Productions. The show opens this coming Friday and runs through May 26.
