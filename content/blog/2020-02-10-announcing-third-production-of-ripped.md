![Postcard for RIPPED at Loud Fridge Theatre Group.](/images/ripped_loud_fridge_theatre_group.jpg)

Here's some great news to start the week: [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) will receive a San Diego premiere this Summer with [Loud Fridge Theatre Group](https://www.loudfridgetheatre.com/)! *RIPPED* will run June 18 through June 28 at On Stage Playhouse in Chula Vista, CA.

I am *thrilled* to have the play in San Diego, where half of it is set. Can't wait to see how many of my San Diego jokes land! I hope if you're in the area you can find time to make it out for the production.

More news about director, cast, and other fun things as we move closer!

Happy Monday!
