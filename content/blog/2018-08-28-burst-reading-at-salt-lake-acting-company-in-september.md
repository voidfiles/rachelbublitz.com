I am absolutely THRILLED to tell everyone that [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) is getting a staged reading with [Salt Lake Acting Company](https://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/) next month!!! I get two big rehearsals, with a week in between for rewrites, and then a public reading on Monday, September 24th at 7pm.

Here are all the wonderful details:

Here's a blurb on *BURST*:

>On the brink of her next round of funding, Sarah Boyd, Founder and CEO of Tactix, must hold her company together through a pesky journalist's questions and glaring doubts thrown her way surrounding the promises her company has made. It's a heavy load, and Sarah knows that she is the only one great enough to bear it.

I hope you can make it! I'd love our take on this brand-new-play of mine.

Happy Tuesday and last few days of August!
