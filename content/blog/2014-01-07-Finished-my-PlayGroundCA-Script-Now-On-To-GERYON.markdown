title: 'Finished my #PlayGroundCA Script, Now On To GERYON!'
---

Okay, I've sent in my first submission for 2014, only 356 to go! The play was *Happy In California*, and it was for Monday Night [PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/)! The topic was CALIFORNIA DREAMIN' and I struggled writing the first half of many plays, sticking with two, and in the end went with my gut and punched my favorite one into shape so that I could make the 2pm deadline. This was a hard month for me, not sure if it's lag from vacation, or something else, but I got it in!

And now I work on *Geryon*! I have a first draft due date set for the end of this month, with hopes to have a reading in February. I'm excited to get the ball rolling, because I have another exciting play I want to get started on, but I'm hoping to have *Geryon* in a second or third draft before I start working that one out.

Okay, *Geryon*, ready, set, GO!
