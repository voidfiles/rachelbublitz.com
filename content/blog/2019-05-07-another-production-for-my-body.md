My ten-minute play [*MY BODY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2541/my-body) is the little play that could, let me tell you. It's had productions around the country, last summer it was in the UK, and next month it's coming to Canada! [Central Alberta Theatre](http://centralalbertatheatrereddeer.com/home) will add *MY BODY* to its annual [CAT's One-Act CATnips Festival 2019](http://centralalbertatheatrereddeer.com/catnips-one-act-festival) in its Black Box theatre. Central Alberta Theatre is in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, and the dates for the festival are June 7, 8, 14, and 15. Find out more about the festival and get tickets on their website: [centralalbertatheatrereddeer.com/catnips-one-act-festival](http://centralalbertatheatrereddeer.com/catnips-one-act-festival).

This will be the 10th production of *MY BODY*, it is by far my most produced and requested script. I'm thinking it's high time to get this play published... An older version was published with Smith & Kraus' 2014 Best Ten Minute Plays, but since 2014 it's had a pretty major rewrite, AND Smith & Kraus doesn't license plays, I'm still having to negotiate my royalties, which is not my favorite thing... SO! Expert playwrights! Who is your favorite publisher of ten-minute plays? I've been thinking of submitting it for Samuel French's OOBF next year (I have not idea why I haven't done this yet!), but that seems like such a long time to wait... Or is there another publisher I should try in the mean time? I now know to send it to only one publisher at a time, my lesson from *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS* has been learned... Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated! Email me your words of publishing wisdom night or day: [Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:Rnbublitz@gmail.com)!

Thank you and happy Tuesday!
