title: BABIES THE ULTIMATE BIRTH CONTROL is Hilarious
---

[BABIES, The Ultimate Birth Control](https://www.facebook.com/events/158170084370589/) *killed* on Saturday! It was *so* funny, and just great all around. The actors were all fabulous, and our director really brought all the pieces together in an interesting and funny way... Not that I'm biased or anything. You should come and see it, and you only have THREE chances left. Then it will only be a happy memory in those lucky people's minds who made it out. Here are the remaining three show dates and times:

SATURDAY September 14 9:00 PM 

SUNDAY September 15 1:00 PM

TUESDAY September 17 9:00 PM

Oh, and hey! [SF Fringe](http://www.sffringe.org/) has a review page for all of the shows, and we've gotten *two* reviews! So, if you needed more reasons to come out:

>David writes, "I could not stop laughing during this show! I am not a parent, and all the humor and ridiculousness of it all still was true and real to me. A bunch of short plays about different parent’s nightmares? Adults playing babies? What really could be better?"

>NLC says, "A brisk and amusing collection of skits and short plays about parenthood, especially its crazy-making aspects. Some scenarios felt more strained than others, but the hour zips by–the ensemble is talented and energetic. Highlight: A very funny turn by a tyrannical-baby-played-by-a-grown-man."

Click this link: [http://www.theexit.org/reviews/babies/#comment-1706](http://www.theexit.org/reviews/babies/#comment-1706) to see the reviews for yourself and to add your own!

I hope to see you there! I will be at the Sunday show with a surprise guest! If you did make it out to the show on Saturday, be sure and leave us a review on the fringe page. It helps us get mroe butts in seats.

THANK YOU!
