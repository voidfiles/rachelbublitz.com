Last night I went and saw MARAT/SADE at Brava in San Francisco. I don't have a ton to say about it... Here's what I got, and take from it what you will:

1. Surprise musical. I really *must* learn read descriptions better.
2. Some of the solo songs were excellent, and Aaron Malberg, who played Jean-Paul Marat was quite good.
3. Mental institutions have lost their "edginess."
4. Well made set and beautiful costumes.
5. No arc in the story, just confusion.
6. And so.... We left at intermission.

Not a must see, sorry to say. Tonight I'm seeing Theatre Pub's Pint Sized Plays though. That will make it all better.
