title: Rejection Update And Hat Tip
---

About an hour ago I was rejected again! For two plays, so that brings it up to 12. Don't think I'll be reaching 100 this year, but it pays to dream big.

ALSO! I forgot to say that my goal of 100 rejections letters was 100% stolen from playwright tock star [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/). She spoke at [Play Cafe](http://www.playcafe.org/)'s playwright conference last year and mentioned it as one of her goals, and I thought it sounded like a fantastic goal and took it on as my own. 

On a totally separate note I am very excited to see [The Custom Made Theatre Co.](http://www.custommade.org/)'s [Eurydice](http://www.custommade.org/201213-season/eurydice/) tonight! If you'd like to get a chance to see the show before it closes for good, The Custom Made Theatre Co. is offering a 2-for-1 ticket deal! Just use the code EU2for1 on their [website](https://app.ticketturtle.com/index.php?ticketing=tcmtc). And tomorrow I have [Saturday Write Fever](https://www.facebook.com/events/460551624015740/?fref=ts), [Playwrights Foundation](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/) rehearsal (I'm the associate produced for their reading of *Forgetting* by [JC Lee](http://jclee1230.wix.com/lee-homepage), come see it on Monday in Stanford or at [NOHSpace](http://www.theatreofyugen.org/) on Tuesday night in the city), AND the making of the [SF Olympians](http://www.sfolympians.com/)' fund raising video! Be jealous, go on... I understand. :)

OH! One more thing... Sign up now to audition with [No Nude Men](http://www.horrorunspeakable.com/companies_nonude.html) for their August production *Age Of Beauty* by [Stuart Bousel](http://dramalist.com/people/2774/stuart-bousel/author/director/actor).
