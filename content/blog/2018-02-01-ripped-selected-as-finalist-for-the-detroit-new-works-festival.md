Time to share my amazing news: *RIPPED* is a finalist for the [2018 Detroit New Works Festival](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/newworks/) with [Outvisible Theatre Company](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/)!!!!!!!!!!! 

I'm delighted and excited and April just can't come soon enough! I've never been to Detroit before, and going there in April will make the fourth straight month in a row of me getting to go to another state to see my work. It also means that from January through May of this year I'll have a public display of my work each month. Come on June and July, someone hit me up quick! Let's keep this good thing going.

The festival will run April 27-29, and before then I'll have lots of exciting information to share with you. If you're in or near Detroit, let me know! I'd love to meet local theater artists while I'm in town!

Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
