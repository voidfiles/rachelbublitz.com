+++

It’s May 2nd already, and since I had so much other news yesterday I decided my submission mission total for the month of April could hold off a day. But now the waiting is over and you *finally* get to find out how many submissions I sent out (I know you were waiting on the edges of your seats)..... SO, for the month of April I sent out a total of 43 scripts! That brings my 2018 total for the year up to……….. 223! Just a hair short of the [½ way point of my goal](https://rachelbublitz.com/2018/01/05/2018-submission-mission/) to send out 450 submissions this year!

Four months down, eight more to go, time to get you done submission mission! Stay tuned to see if or when I make it!
