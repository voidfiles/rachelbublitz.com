title: Football Is Hard
---

I'm not quite back to the world yet (still in my stay-cation), but I wanted to take a break to tell everyone about life for me right now... I'm 45 pages into my Achilles/football play and this is what I've learned...

1. Writing a scene in which people play football on stage is hard.
2. I know very little about football.

I need to catch a game... Listen to the jargon, the rhythm. There has to be football on youtube, right? I sure hope so. I'm calling it quits for tonight, but I'm hoping to have a solid (ha!) first draft by this Friday. Happy almost New Years!
