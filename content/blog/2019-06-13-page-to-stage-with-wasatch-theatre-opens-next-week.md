The summer keeps on moving, and the new plays keep on coming! If you're in or near Salt Lake City, please join me for [Wasatch Theatre Company](https://www.wasatchtheatre.org/)'s [Page-to-Stage 2019 Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/439440473512068/) which opens next Friday, June 21st! The evening is made up of short work by five of the six members of the Utah Playwrights Collective. The full line-up is:

["*Open*"](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138814/open) by Nicholas Dunn  
["*Lucy and the Statue*"](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/318238/lucy-and-statue) by Jennifer Kokai  
["*Toxic*"](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/123895/toxic) by Rachel Bublitz  
"*Cherry Pie*" by [Melissa Leilani Larson](https://newplayexchange.org/users/452/melissa-leilani-larson)  
"*Farkin' Hubert*" by [Matthew Ivan Bennett ](https://newplayexchange.org/users/749/matthew-ivan-bennett)  
AND, a very special bonus play called ["*Not About A Cat*"](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/408100/not-about-cat-co-written-rachel-bublitz), which Jennifer Kokai and I wrote together to round out the evening.

I'm really excited to share *TOXIC* with the public for the first time, this will be the first production and even first public performance. And I'm thrilled to be getting to know Wasatch Theatre Company as well! I'm looking forward to what comes from them in the future, they've just announced their new artistic director as Nicholas Dunn, who has lots of great ideas for future seasons.

Elizabeth Golden will be directing this years' festival, who is as much of a joy to watch on stage as to watch her working with actors. And we have the acting talents of Chelsea Hickman, Angie Andrus, Sterling Shane Allen, and Bryce Fueston.

The Page-to-Stage Festival runs June 21st - 29th at 8pm at Wasatch Theatre, at the Gateway downtown Salt Lake. Buy your tickets here: [www.wasatchtheatre.org/box-office](https://www.wasatchtheatre.org/box-office).

More premieres, productions, and other announcements are on their way folks, so be sure and stay tuned!
