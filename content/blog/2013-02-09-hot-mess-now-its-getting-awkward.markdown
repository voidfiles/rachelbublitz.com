title: 'Hot Mess: Now It''s Getting Awkward'
---

My Friday night was hilarious. I was feeling better than I had all week, and my brilliant theatre mate, [Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2), asked if I wanted to join her to see [Hot Mess: Now It's Getting Awkward](https://www.facebook.com/events/524491997583175/?fref=ts) at the [New Conservatory Theatre Center](http://www.nctcsf.org/). I did indeed. I'd missed their past shows, and I was eager to finally see this relatively new sketch comedy group (they're a year old). Let me say officially, I never want to miss one of their shows again! They made me laugh so hard it hurt and I loved it. It was one of those shows that you wish you had all of your friends with you because you know how much they'd like the show too. It's too good to not share. 

My favorite sketch was "The Pack" written by Alani Foxall. It has a group of women sexually harassing a couple of construction workers, and it was every bit as good as the set up sounds. So! Go see Hot Mess! It runs this weekend and next in San Francisco. Here's a bit more about it from their website......

>It's been a whole year since we gave birth to San Francisco's biggest sketch comedy train wreck, and we are thrilled that NCTC invited us back for two hot weekends of shows...especially after the mess we made the last time.

>So put on your pants, and don't make eye contact, because it's about to get awkward!

>Featuring our hot messy pool of actors, writers, and directors...Giovanna Arieta, Spencer Bainbridge, Kirsten Broadbear, Megan Cohen, Annie Diehl, Alani Foxall, Jesus Fuentes, Joe Jordan, Sang S. Kim, Renee LeVesque, Dave Levine, Pearl Maril, James Martin, Colin McCarthy, Sarah Moser, Tonya Narvaez, Shaun Plander, Kaeli Quick, Sara Staley, Evan Wagoner-Lynch.

Now I'm off, got to clean the house before I take off to see two (yes two!) shows today. I'm seeing [*Se Llama Cristina*](http://magictheatre.org/season/se-llama-cristina) from [Magic Theatre](http://magictheatre.org/) at 2:30! It's a free show over here in the East Bay at [Laney College Theater Arts](http://www.laney.edu/wp/theater/). Sounds rad, right? [Here's the schedule for the other free shows they are offering this year](http://magictheatre.org/about/oakland). Then tonight I'm finally getting to see [Why Torture is Wrong, and the People who Love Them](http://www.custommade.org/why-torture-is-wrong-and-the-people-who-love-them/) at [Custom Made Theatre Company](http://www.custommade.org/)! Today is a very good day.
