title: Volunteering at SF Fringe
---

I spent 1/2 my day yesterday volunteering at [SF Fringe](http://www.sffringe.org/)'s hospitality suite, a place to sit back, enjoy some strawberry or cucumber flavored water, make a mask, munch on some fresh popped popcorn, or all three at the same time. The staff at [The Exit](http://www.theexit.org/) has gone out of their way to make everyone involved in the Fringe festival feel welcome, and they have done a fabulous job. Yesterday, I enjoyed sandwiches at their SF Fringe party (everyone involved with the shows was invited for a delicious sandwich mixer), got to see a show for free (as a volunteer I can see any show at Fringe for free that isn't sold out), AND I got to catch-up with friends both old and new, and meet new artists. I talked with the woman behind [Nightingale](http://www.sffringe.org/nightingale/), a show that everyone raves about, one that I'm trying to catch next Saturday, the actors from [O Best Beloved](http://www.sffringe.org/obest/), another show getting fantastic feedback, and many others. Meeting artists from near and far, learning more about those artists you already know, it's all a part of living and creating in a community. As someone who hopes to create more in this community, it's a no-brainer for me to get to know the folks in my community better.

I mean, I got to spend hours painting masks! Do you know how often I have the chance to do something like that? Never. The answer is never.

So, if you missed the boat volunteering this year at Fringe Festival, there's always next year! I had a great time, and I can't recommend it enough. Thank you [Stuart Bousel](http://endymionrising.blogspot.com/), Christina Augello, and everyone else who works so hard making Fringe Festival awesome!
