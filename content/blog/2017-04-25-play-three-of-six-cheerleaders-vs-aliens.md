2017 keeps chugging, and I'm still on track for churning out SIX new full-length plays for my [six new play plan](https://rachelbublitz.com/2017/01/03/six-play-plan-for-2017/) for the year. Up now: *CHEERLEADERS VS ALIENS*, a commission from the [Egyptian Youtheatre](http://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre)!

This year, on top of writing six new full-length plays, I also wanted to stretch myself as a writer. The first play *NO MAP*, is a hot mess, but it's also a style of play I've never written, something that plays with time and structure and doesn't follow a typical arc. *LET'S FIX ANDY*, is an all male cast, another first for me. And *CHEERLEADERS VS ALIENS* is a LOT of things I've never tackled before: it's a full-length play intended to be performed by high school students, it's a full-length sci-fi play, and (most challenging of all) it will have a cast of AT LEAST TWENTY. The task is a little daunting, but I can't wait to jump in and figure this one out. After all, playwriting is not for the faint of heart.

More on *CHEERLEADERS VS ALIENS* soon, including the director whom I'll be meeting for the first time later this morning. Go Tuesday go!
