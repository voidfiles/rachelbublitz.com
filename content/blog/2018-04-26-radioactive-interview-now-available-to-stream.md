We were on the radio last night, we were interviewed by one of Laura Jone's co-hosts, Billy Palmer! The cast absolutely *killed* the scenes, they were so great! You can click above to listen in, our interview was shifted a bit and we start right at 32:33 and finish out the episode. 

Here are the cast members who joined us to share their vocal talent on air:

* Amanda Green (Gilda, school dork and heroine)
* Lindsay Miller (Leslie, cheerleader)
* Kat Moss (Maya, cheerleader)
* Amanda Rossi (Samantha, cheerleader)
* Katherine Ward (Margaret, cheerleader)
* Gemma Feltovich (Mindy, only female on football team)
* Zach Mazzie (Epsilon, friendly alien)
