We're are three weeks into 2019, can you believe it? Which means I'm on the third week of [52 Plays by Women](https://twitter.com/52playsbywomen)! This week I read the gorgeous play [*APPLE SEASON*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/53260/apple-season) by [EM Lewis](https://newplayexchange.org/users/1044/e-m-lewis) which just opened its rolling world premiere at [New Jersey Rep](http://www.njrep.org/). Reading this play on the page made my heart ache for the chance to see it in production, it is just screaming with spectacle and theatricality, something Lewis uses with such a deft and precise hand. *APPLE SEASON* will go on to [Riverside Theatre](https://www.riversidetheatre.org/), and [Moving Arts](https://movingarts.org/) in LA. Fingers crossed I can make it out to either of those shows OR someone brings it closer... Hint, hint, nudge, nudge!

Here's my [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) recommendation:

>" A haunting look at trauma and time. Are places our memory keepers, and would avoiding or destroying them set us free? This question is at the center of EM Lewisâ€™ beautiful script. Time is played with in a highly theatricality manner, and the spectacle written into the stage direction has me wishing for a near to me production of this play. So well crafted, highly recommend."

I can't wait for next week! What will I read or watch? This is the best challenge ever.

Happy Monday!
