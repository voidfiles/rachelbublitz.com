Happy February! I'm still on catch-up mode over here... First I was recovering from the holidays and now I'm totally distracted by the Olympics. Watching ladies' doubles luge as I write this, or as I like to call it: pancake luge. It is as visually hilarious as it is dangerous, and wow those athletes much have the most insanely strong core muscles.

But I'm not here to write about the Olympics, but to tell you that Smith & Kraus' [The Best Women's Stage Monologues 2025](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Womens-Stage-Monologues-2025/dp/1575259842/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2BDYOR8UYIXFG&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qeHOmKERfAShULKjJHL3KwCAHgr73uTJWPh-VtVIDd_W5Cl4oRDhNkhoU0ccxgFXLxDr40tNwFof4hcy-VF4LMZGc85gofq_HSBQKaWftg6VQET_T9DRFmWl-OuR7_tU7Swj4Gu_j9tlQ7mwUwIukJKJfqdlHgK5fO8X6jKMpxIvmYHQNTEjJG8YvL2bMZAsccWXLV1wvLDLWUGkgwMJcA9MBNhMaWN8c6vYC3NkYRk.ivfanmMGDY9LZ-aWdNNC5hxfs92L8BR3R7WnLleNVr0&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+best+women%27s+stage+monologues+2025&qid=1770833428&sprefix=the+best+women%27s+stage+monologues+2025%2Caps%2C206&sr=8-1) is out and available on Amazon! I've got a monologue in there, one from my play [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/funnylikeanabortion)! I can't recommend picking it up enough! Monologue collections are fabulous ways to get to know new playwrights and get a taste of their work. Directors may find new work that they want to pitch, actors may find new audition material, and theater lovers may find new scripts/playwrights to love. If you get a copy and then feel like you really need to read all of my play, find it available with [Original Works Publishing](https://www.originalworksonline.com/funnylikeanabortion)!

By the way, Italy just won gold! I'm such a fan of glory for the host nation!

Happy Wednesday, expect more regular updates from me starting now!
