title: Another Sheherezade XII Review
---

[Annette Lust](http://annettelustforallevents.blogspot.com/), who runs [The Fringe of Marin](http://www.fringeofmarin.com/index.html) reviewed Sheherezade XII! This is what she had to say about "Her Special Day":

>"Her Special Day by Rachel Bublitz depicts the preparation for a wedding during which the mention of the Mayan prediction of the end of the world  seems as if it will ruin the bride's special day but rather takes on a comic turn through the reactions  of the bride's mother who at one point suggests they flee to Mexico and then concludes that they only have a couple of weeks left anyway." -Annette Lust

This is closing weekend for Sheherezade XII. There are performances tonight, Friday and Saturday. Last I checked, Friday and Saturday were incredibly close to selling out. So, unless you have already purchased your tickets tonight might be your last chance to see the show! Buy your tickets [here](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/240310). I am thrilled to have been a part of this show, and I hope you make it out to see it before it's over!
