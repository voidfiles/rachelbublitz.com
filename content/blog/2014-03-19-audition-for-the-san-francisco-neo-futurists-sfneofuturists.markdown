title: Audition For The San Francisco Neo-Futurists @sfneofuturists
---

If you've gotten the chance to watch the [San Francisco Neo-Futurists](http://www.sfneofuturists.com/) over at Boxcar Playhouse (or in New York or Chicago) you know what a great show it is. If you haven't, what the hell are you waiting for? Really? Anyway, if you've seen it and loved it, or have at least heard how much everyone else loves it, and have been toying with the idea of getting involved, NOW IS YOUR CHANCE!

Auditions are coming up at the end of this month! You have the chance to join the crew and bring your own brand of hilarious honesty to the show. 

>"AUDITION FOR THE NEO-FUTURISTS
