Day three of our warm up! Today my play came to me when I was out on a run...

*A park.*  

MOM 
You're not allowed to sleep in the park! There are children playing, I should call the police and get you arrested.  

TRAMP 
At least I don't shit in the park.  

MOM 
Excuse me? I would never-  

TRAMP Your son just shit on the slide.
