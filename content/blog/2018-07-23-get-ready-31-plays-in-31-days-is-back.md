July is coming to an end, and for all the die-hard playwrights out there that means only one thing.... The August-packed playwriting challenge: [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/)! I had this wild and crazy idea back in April of 2012, blogged about it, and to my surprise many, many playwrights heard the call and took the challenge on themselves. I was astonished, my partner in crime and the one with the idea to make this a public challenge, [Tracy Held Potter](http://tracyheldpotter.com/), was not. And over the years we've both had the opportunity to watch it grow and grow.

Now in its *seventh* year 31 Plays in 31 Days has kicked playwrights from all over the world in the butt. For the past few years the amazing [Topher Cusumano](http://tophercusumano.com/) (founder and co-director of [Gnome Haus](https://www.gnomehaus.org/) in New York) has been steering the ship, and this year he's bringing in a new volunteer to support him, Abigail Taylor-Sansom, a current MFA student from Savannah College of Art & Design. 

If you're fingers are twitching just reading this, the best way to stay up-to-date is to like the [31 Plays in 31 Days facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/31Plays31Days/), where you'll find submission information, and where the daily prompts will be posted come August 1st. And be sure to get on it quick, August 1st is only nine days away!

Get ready to write your hearts out! Happy Monday!
