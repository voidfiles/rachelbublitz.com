title: Heading to Denver Tomorrow for the New Play Summit!
---

Much rejoicing! I'm leaving tomorrow on a jet airplane to Denver, Colorado for [Denver Center For The Performing Arts](https://www.denvercenter.org/)' [New Play Summit](https://www.denvercenter.org/events/colorado-new-play-summit)! Last year I caught one of the readings and a world premiere and was more than a little bummed I hadn't seen more. But this year, *this* year I'm seeing it alllllllll.

I go out tomorrow in the morning and I'll catch [*The Christians* by Lucas Hnath](https://www.denvercenter.org/shows/specific-series/Get?Id=aa9092a7-640c-41d2-b40b-f98225f96283) in the evening, and then starting Friday I'll be hitting the ground and running through all the great new work Denver has to offer. This'll include readings of:

[*Blind Date* by Rogelio Martinez](https://www.denvercenter.org/events/colorado-new-play-summit/people-plays)

[*Last Night and the Night Before* by Donnetta Lavinia Grays](https://www.denvercenter.org/events/colorado-new-play-summit/people-plays)

[*The Great Leap* by fellow PlayGround alumni and June Anne Baker award winner Lauren Yee](https://www.denvercenter.org/events/colorado-new-play-summit/people-plays)

[*Human Error* by Eric Pfeffinger](https://www.denvercenter.org/events/colorado-new-play-summit/people-plays)

[*Hanussen* by Robert Schenkkan](https://www.denvercenter.org/events/colorado-new-play-summit/people-plays)

And it's not just readings! I'll also catch the world premiere productions of two new plays:

[*The Book of Will* by Lauren Gunderson](https://www.denvercenter.org/shows/specific-series/Get?Id=bbd8b395-9105-46a3-b529-bb2909367bc8)

and

[*Two Degrees* by Tira Palmquist](https://www.denvercenter.org/shows/specific-series/Get?Id=5b14a66c-ca82-448b-8d48-9b939d9f873c)

ALL THE THEATER! I can't wait. And as an added bonus I've got a whole hotel room to myself, which is basically the closest thing to heaven one can have on earth (I love my kids but hot damn do I love time to myself). I'm baking my family a pie to hold in my absence, and not looking back.

I'll see you tomorrow, Denver!
