I'm a train that keeps on chugging- I leave a week from tomorrow for my first visit to Detroit, Michigan! My full-length play [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) is a finalist for the [Detroit New Works Festival](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/playwriting-opportunities/newworks/), hosted by [Outvisible Theatre Company](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/)! [The festival will host readings of five new plays](https://rachelbublitz.com/2018/02/13/full-detroit-new-works-2018-festival-lineup/) over Saturday the 28th and Sunday the 29th of April, and will announce a winner from those five plays Sunday night. The winner will receive a world premiere production with Outvisible Theatre Company! 

I can't wait to spend a weekend immersed in new plays and meeting new theater artists! And the folks at the top of my list are the wonderful actors that were cast in my reading! And so without further ado, the actors in the April 28th (2:30pm!) reading of *RIPPED* directed by [Mycah Artis](http://www.serotoninsyndrome.us/about.php) are: [Anna Doyle](https://www.annadoyleactor.com/) as Lucy, [Michael Lopetrone](http://www.michaellopetrone.com/) as Bradley, and Scott Anthony Joy as Jared! I always learn so much through the wonderful work of actors, and I know this will be no different. 

Detroit, here I come (next week)!
