Finally get to announce the exciting addition to my Bay Area trip this weekend!...... [PlayGround](https://playground-sf.org/) is having a table reading of [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) tomorrow morning! It's been a while since I've had the chance to work with PlayGround, and I can't wait to see everyone tomorrow.

And on top of working with the awesome folks of PlayGround, this'll be the first time I've heard this new post-[Ground & Field Theatre Festival](https://www.groundandfield.com/) draft! So many good things.

*BURST* also received an amazing rejection letter this week, which took multiple paragraphs to sing its praises. Keeping my fingers crossed that I can keep this momentum up for this play. I can see it working for lots of theaters around the country...

Interested in giving it a read? You can find it on my [New Play Exchange page](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz)! Or [email me](mailto: rnbublitz@gmail.com) for a perusal copy.

See you tomorrow bright and early, Bay Area!
