title: Countdown to reading of UNDER THE GODS' GOLDEN CLEATS
---

Eleven days! ELEVEN DAYS guys! In eleven days the [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) will present a staged reading of *Under The Gods'Golden Cleats*! We start rehearsing this Sunday! I cannot wait to get into the rehearsal room and hear my fabulous actors! This week I've been trying to trim down my script as much as humanly possible. For some reason, I like to use ellipses like they're going out of style. I also write ridiculous stage directions, which normally isn't a big deal, but since these are going to be READ OUT LOUD, I need to make sure they also have a nice sound to them. All of this, and cuts, cuts, cuts. I shaved a few pages, so my it's down to 125 pages! And it only hurt my soul a little. It's odd though, I'll be paring down a scene and I'll tear my heart out by cutting a line or two, and then on a second read I realize that the scene doesn't actually need those lines at all, only the necessary can stay, and things are getting brutal.

Hope you make it out on November 9th (8pm at the Exit)! Here's the facebook page for more details:
