Ready to jump in the pool this November? Because *Hear Us Roar*, my historical water polo play, is getting its' feet wet for the first time! I'm thrilled to announce that [*Hear Us Roar* is receiving a workshop production through the University of Utah's Studio Series](https://utheatre.booktix.com/dept/SS/e/HUR). The workshop will be directed by Alexandra Harbold, and we will receive dramaturgy from a real water polo playing dramaturg: Samantha Stringham. I'm thrilled that all the moving pieces of the this has fallen into place and we can start to play with the fun stuff... Like how to show a water polo play on stage without a pool.

The performances will be available to the public, and [you can book your tickets now](https://utheatre.booktix.com/dept/SS/e/HUR)! Our dates are: Thursday, November 20 at 7:30, Friday, November 21 at 7:30, and Sunday, November 23 at both 2 and 7:30.

Here's more about *Hear Us Roar*:

>*At their first practice, Hawthorne University's club water polo team receives earth shattering news: this is their last season because next year they will become an official NCAA team. Elation doesn't even cover it. This means funding, this means support; transportation and team suits are just the tip of the iceberg! But, it also means growing pains. Not all the players from the club will be asked to stay on, and the best will get offers from other colleges. Can the Lions come together and play as a team, or will all the uncertainty surrounding their future drive an insurmountable divide among the players? Set in the late 90's, when women's water polo saw a nationwide explosion after it was announced it would be included in the Olympics for the first time in history. This play is a love letter to the game, and the players who put all their heart, soul, grit, and moxie into it. GO LIONS!*
