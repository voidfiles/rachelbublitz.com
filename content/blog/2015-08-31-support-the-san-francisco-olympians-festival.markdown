title: Support The San Francisco Olympians Festival
---

Friends and fellow theater artists, you are running out of time. One of the most inclusive and expansive theater events in the Bay Area is in the middle of raising funds, and if you don't act fast, you'll miss your chance to support them. And trust me, you don't want to miss that chance.

The [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/), now in its sixth year, commissions new work from local writers, then gives directors and actors the chance to play with these brand new works. I have been blown away by the readings and plays that come out of this festival, and I have meet collaborators through the festival that I wouldn't trade for all the tea in England (ps, I've taken a strong liking to tea).

And then there are the other writers! Let me tell you, as a writer, we are often pitted in competition with other writers. And our time, well my time often, is spent alone, that is, at least, if you ignore my kids banging on the door begging me to stop writing and feed them. BUT, something the SF Olympians Festival gives to me and all of its writers is community. We meet, we share pages, we work through problems, we email, we get advice, we share pie and other tasty food and drinks, we make the life of a writer a little less lonely and a lot less competitive. This is a huge gift Artistic Director [Stuart Bousel](https://twitter.com/stuartbousel) gives to everyone he invites to write for the festival, and it's another HUGE reason why you should give them your money now.

ALSO, if all of that wasn't enough, they add opportunities to fine artists by commissioning works from them to represent each of the evenings.

With only NINE days left and $2,673 to raise, I hope you'll join me in supporting the SF Olympians Festival. There's no one else quite like them, and they absolutely deserve your support.
