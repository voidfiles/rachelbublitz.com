title: What To Submit For PlayGround?
---

[PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/) posted their submission guidelines today for their writers pool. I'm not going to lie to you, I want to be in the writers pool. I want it bad. For those of you who aren't sure what PlayGround is, I'll break it down for you. PlayGround has playwrights submit to be in their writers pool, they select the top 36 to form their pool. Then, throughout their season they send prompts out to the writers, and the writers write. There are six nights, you must submit to five of them if you're in the pool, and the best of these plays are given staged readings throughout the year. At the end of their season they do the Best of PlayGround and produce the best short plays written that year. It would be an amazing way for me to expand the folks that I know, and for new people to see my work.

So now I need to pick which play I'll be submitting. I don't have a ton of ten minute plays, right now I have eight. It's hard to pick one when you want something so much, how can you tell which one is best? Good thing I have until August 31st! 

Heard or read my work? Let me know which one you like the best!
