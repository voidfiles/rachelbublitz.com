title: Gritty City Repertory Youth Theatre

The future is children, yes? Whether we like it or not, they are younger and will likely be sticking around after us. That's one of the reasons why I like what [Gritty City Repertory Youth Theatre](http://www.grittycityrep.org/gcr#!__gcr) has got going on. Their mission from their website:

>"Mission: Gritty City Repertory Youth Theatre provides Oakland youth with access to performing arts programs that nurture, stimulate & transform. We create unique spaces where young adults feel inspired to risk and explore, developing leadership, confidence, and empathy for their human family through the production of powerful theatre."

As a kid I remember first getting into a theatre and trying out acting for the first time... It was like I could be at ease with myself suddenly... I knew after that that the theatre and I were going to spend some serious time together. But even for kids who don't want to make the life long commitment, I think it's important. Being involved with theatre offers a lot; you learn how to think quick on your feet (especially when your fellow actors can't remember their lines), you learn how to come together with your peers and create, and you feel pride over that which you create. I feel like even the dreadful shows I was in in high school helped mold me into the person I am now. We need more theatre lovers, and so I say start 'em young! No better way than hooking them as young ones (it's like drugs but in a much healthier way).

That brings me all the way back to [Gritty City Repertory Youth Theatre](http://www.grittycityrep.org/gcr#!__gcr). That's just what they're doing... Hooking kids into performing arts and letting them shine. This is a local company over in Oakland, and right now they have Shakespeare's *The Tempest* playing now until May 19th. 

Here are all the details:

###THE TEMPEST by William Shakespeare

Directed by [Lindsay Krumbein](http://www.grittycityrep.org/gcr#!__gcr/staff-bios) and Colleen Egan.

May 9th-12th, and 16th-18th

[Vagabond Ballroom](http://vagabondballroom.wordpress.com/), [830 Isabella Street, Oakland, CA](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=830+Isabella+Street,+Oakland,+CA&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x808f80a8133d705d:0xe3692c21b95016d6,830+Isabella+St,+Oakland,+CA+94607&gl=us&ei=3w-MUeXqL-q5iwLHqYCYCQ&ved=0CDAQ8gEwAA).

Here's a bit more about the show from their website:

>"This production of Shakespeare's classic will awaken your imagination. Our *Tempest* is set in the 1930's. Prospero, the Duchess of Milan, losses her dukedom in a gangster take-over, and is cast out to sea. She lands safely on a defunct, rusted out Coney Island with her tiny daughter Miranda, and takes over as ringmaster, developing her magical powers, and plotting her revenge. Year's later, adventure and intrigue abound on the island, where a caged monster dwells, a ship-wracked prince falls in love, and villainous siblings plot dastardly deeds! Join us at the Vagabond Ballroom this spring - we guarantee a *Tempest* like none you've ever seen before!"
