Eeeeeeeeeeee! *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS* had its first cast read through on Saturday, [tickets are now on sale](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/index.php?option=com_holdmyticket&view=event&id=299374), and I now there's promotional art ready for the show! It is all just SO FREAKIN' EXCITING! 

I'm telling you, May can't come soon enough. But luckily there's a poster and promo photos in the works which should slightly help in the wait. And, if you're *that* curious about the play, feel free to download the latest draft on my [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119869/cheerleaders-vs-aliens) page! I've already gotten one great recommendation for the play:

>"You have to love a play where the football players are the victims and the cheerleaders are their saviors. There's a lot of silliness combined with teen-speak, snarky dialogue that perfectly captures the teen spirit. I loved the constant element of surprise that awaited me with every page turn. Bublitz deftly steers away from the jock/mean girl stereotype that often peppers these plays and offers us some real teens: warts and all. The play is a wonderful tin-foil romp through the stars. Teen performers and young audiences will love this." - [Claudia Haas](https://newplayexchange.org/users/948/claudia-haas)

Stay tuned for more, because more is on its way!

Happy Monday everyone!
