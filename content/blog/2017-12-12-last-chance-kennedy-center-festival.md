Toot the horn, ring the bell, I've got *one* last chance to get to the national Kennedy Center 10-minute play festival this April! My ten-minute play *MY BODY* has been selected as a Region 7 semi-finalist, which means I'll be heading up to Spokane in February to present the play and attend the conference! You're allowed to participate in the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival up to two years after you graduate with your masters degree so this is my final eligible year. *MOM'S HAM* was a national semi-finalist in 2015, and *LEAN IN WITH LIZ!* was a national semi-finalist in 2016. I'm hoping 2018 is finally the year I make it all the way, but even if I don't, I've met some of my favorite collaborators at this conference, so I'm very excited to make new theater friends and connect again with those I already know.
