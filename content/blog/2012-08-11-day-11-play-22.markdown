title: Day 11, Play 22
---

Had an easy day today, I only wrote one play! True, the night is still young, but I'l about to head off to see [Pat Milton](http://www.patricia-milton.com/)'s new play [BELIEVERS](https://www.facebook.com/events/260010557445325/) at [Stage Werx](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=446+Valencia+st,+San+Francisco,+California+94103&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x808f7e223b6528bd:0x87a1da459677f301,446+Valencia+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94103&gl=us&ei=hwsnUMS7DMuJiwL03YC4Dg&ved=0CAoQ8gEwAA). It's playing until August 25th so you'll still have chances to see it! 

I might get home and write play #23 tonight, but I doubt it. I feel much more relaxed about the whole thing now that I have less than 10 plays to go. Happy Saturday!!
