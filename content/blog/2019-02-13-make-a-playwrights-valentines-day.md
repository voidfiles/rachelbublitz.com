Hey theater lovers, tomorrow is VALENTINE'S DAY! And what better way to celebrate Valentine's Day than by making a playwright's day (or week/month/year!)? playwright, screenwriter, and board game designer [Greg Lam](https://newplayexchange.org/users/2619/greg-lam) has maybe the sweetest Valentine's Day surprise for playwrights but he needs YOU!......

His idea is that so often literary managers, dramaturgs, artistic directors, and other theater artists read scripts that they love, but they aren't able to use at the moment, and aren't able to tell a playwright how they feel about their script without raising expectations. But Greg is offering to send anonymous notes to playwrights from folks who aren't otherwise in a position to give praise. And he plans to send them out TOMORROW for Valentine's Day!

Being a playwright is an uphill slog. You get told no 10 times than you're told yes, and that's on a good day. Rejection is a part of the gig, I get that, but I don't think honest encouragement is ever a bad idea. Plus, as we're in the middle of rejection season, and playwrights might be opening up multiple rejections in a day, a cheering note might be just what they need to put some bounce back in their typing fingers and step.

If you're interested in spreading some love and good cheer, find all the [details right here](https://twitter.com/pairofdicegreg/status/1093155401720389632)! And act fast, the deadline is coming up!

Happy *almost* Valentine's Day!
