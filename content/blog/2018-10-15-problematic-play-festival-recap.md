The Bay Area trip was, as usual, AMAZING. This was particularly packed with theater, tasty food, rehearsals, late night talks, and nerves.... I don't think I've ever been as nervous as I was during this reading of *RIPPED* in [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/)'s Problematic Play Festival, I was actually shaking during the performance. But apart from the nerves, the experience was pretty special. I always love working with new artists, and Z Space is a phenomenally supportive group and space. I wrote a new scene, which was one of those special rewrites that comes out nearly perfect and feels like it's been in the play the whole time. I'm feeling electric about this play, and I've posted a whole new draft of *RIPPED* on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) ([check that out right here!](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped))! HUGE thank you to everyone at Z Space, the wonderful actors who trusted me and worked SO hard on this very heavy material, and all the great folks who came out to watch the reading.

Now to use all the energy and work all those angels and hope like hell a production will finally come through. The discussion after gave me a tremendous amount of hope for this play. I do think the time of the play is now, and I do hope that I get to share it with a whole lot more people.

So stay tuned, hopefully there's more coming about this play and its journey. For now, naps!! I've got a lot of sleep to catch up on.

Happy Monday everyone!
