[*Ripped*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/ripped) is coming to San Diego! [Loud Fridge Theatre Group](https://www.loudfridge.com/) is staging the San Diego premiere, and I couldn't be more excited! *Ripped* takes place in both Berkeley and San Diego, and after hearing the Bay Area response from the 2019 [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/) production, I cannot wait to hear what San Diego thinks! Will they agree that the Bay Area has vastly inferior Mexican food? I think they will, but soon I will know for sure!

*Ripped*, running January 20 - February 5, 2023 at OnStage Playhouse, will be directed by Kate Rose Reynolds and John Wells III, and have the acting talents of Amira Temple (Lucy), Marcel Ferrin (Jared), and Devin Wade (Bradley). More soon, I promise! 

I am trying to make it out for opening weekend, so come and say hello!
