*Map of productions happening in the Spring of 2025.*

Here, there, and everywhere! So pumped for this Spring season where my work will be on stages not only across the country (even as far West as Hawaii!), but also abroad with multiple productions in Canada, one production in Ireland, and another in England!

[*Midnight Bandits*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/midnight-bandits), a ten-minute play, which is a part of a collection of ten-minute plays from [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/) called [*Rogues' Gallery*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/rogues-gallery), is far and above my most produced play this coming season, but I'm thrilled to have so many of my titles getting productions! Here's the full list:
