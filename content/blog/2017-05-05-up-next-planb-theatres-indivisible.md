Free (yes *free*!) tickets are still available for [Plan-B Theatre](http://planbtheatre.org/)'s [(in)divisible](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/indivisible-tickets-31307655039)! Part of their [Script-in-Hand Series](http://planbtheatre.org/scriptinhandseries/), 12 local playwrights were asked to write two new 5 minute plays in response to the election. One is from a liberal perspective, the other conservative, and we weren't allowed to name names (as in, no mention of Trump, Clinton, Obama, Sanders, etc.).

Have a lot of feelings about the politics? We do too. No better place than the theater to let it all out. 

List of all star playwrights writing for (in)divisible: Austin Archer, [Matthew Ivan Bennett](https://newplayexchange.org/users/749/matthew-ivan-bennett), Carleton Bluford, [Rachel Bublitz](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz) (hey, that's me!), [Elaine Jarvik](https://newplayexchange.org/users/1654/elaine-jarvik), [Julie Jensen](https://newplayexchange.org/users/7849/julie-jensen), [Jennifer A.
