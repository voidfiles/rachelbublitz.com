title: Bay One Acts Kickstarter Kicks Off
---

Last year I was blown away by BOA 12, see my blog post [here](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2012/05/10/things-i-learned-at-boa-program-1/), and that's why I'm so excited that this year [All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/) is a producing partner for BOA 13 ([Bay One Acts Festival](http://bayoneacts.org/))! BOA kicked off their [Kickstarter Campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boa-x/2013-bay-one-acts-festival-boa) yesterday, I gave and so should you!

It is a great theater community builder, and the festival is always not to be missed. You have until September 17th to donate, but don't wait! Watch the video, donate, and tell your friends!

You will not regret it.
