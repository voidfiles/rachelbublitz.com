title: Closing Night of 2012 SF Olympians Festival
---

Tonight is the final night of the 2012 [SF Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/)! Tonight features two local playwrights:

[Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/)'s play *Zeus* (which, yes, is about Zeus) will go head to head with Christian Simonsen's play, *Chronus* (which is about Chronus, you're awfully clever).

I was at the show last night, which was completely sold out, and it was a lot of fun; [Barbara Jwanouskos](https://twitter.com/bjwany)'s play *Hera* was hilarious (male pregnancy was involved).

Be sure and make it out tonight, and come early!
