Very excited to announce that [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) has been selected for [The Road Theatre Company](https://roadtheatre.org/)'s 12th Summer Playwrights Festival! All of the plays will stream online. The festival runs July 15th through August 1st.

*BURST* will be performed on the final day of the festival, Sunday, August 1st at 2pm (PST). *BURST* will be directed by Christina Carlisi, with the acting talents of Allison Blaize (Sarah), Paris Perrault (Weaver), and Samantha Tan (Alexis).

I cannot wait to dig into this play again, I feel so lucky to have a brand new set of artists to play with, and that the play will be heard by a whole new audience! It's also really special to be working with The Road Theatre again. In 2019 they did a reading of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped), and it was a fantastic experience from the beginning to the end.

More to come, as we get closer. For now mark off that first day of August for some good ol' online theater!
