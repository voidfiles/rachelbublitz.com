Last week I auditioned with the Actors Ensemble of Berkeley.  They are a company that does staged readings of plays.  I auditioned for Pirandello’s “Henry IV” and “Proof” by David Auburn.  I won’t lie, I was nervous.  I had already chickened out of an audition a few months ago.   I haven’t acted in over four years, and the thought of getting back into it sent chills up my spine.  I still don’t really understand why.  I’ve never been afraid of being in front of people.  It’s like I became another person after having children, someone who didn’t have the abilities the old me had.  This was a terribly depressing to me.  I had to know for sure if I needed to hang up my acting cloak for good, so I went to the auditions, nervous as hell.  

Then a funny thing happened.  I got there, I read for them, and I wasn’t nervous at all.  It felt great in fact.  I didn’t get a part, but that was fine, not getting cast in either play effected me less than when a company rejects a play I’ve written.  Maybe I’m a writer at heart after all.

By the way, my head shot and acting resume are RIDICULOUS.  I might have to post them later on just for a laugh.
