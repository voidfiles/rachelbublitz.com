title: Fabulous Reading Last Night
---

Big thanks again for everyone who made it out last night for the developmental reading of MY SISTER'S BABY. It was great to finally hear the whole thing out loud, and even better to hear feedback.

Now it's back to the drawing board on the play... I need to have it ready within a few weeks for more submissions. I might give myself one day off before I start in on it.... We'll see.

Here are some great photos from after the reading last night:
