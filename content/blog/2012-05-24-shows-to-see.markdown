Directed by [Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2)

Who says men own the monopoly on sex fantasies? Pull the sheets off of one stay-at-home-mom's dirty little secret with The Fantasy Club. You'll never look at housewives the same again.

####June 11th

Staged reading of [Friar Lazaro, or the King of Terrors](http://bridgetteportman.blogspot.com/p/plays.html) by [Bridgette Dutta Portman](http://bridgetteportman.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html)
Directed by [Joy Brooke Fairfield](http://joybrookefairfield.org/)

Set in a Spanish mission in 19th-century California, Friar Lazaro tells the story of a young padre whose religious doubts lead him to madness and murder. Lazaro, tormented by the possibility that that nothing lies beyond death, begins to murder ill Indians in order to witness their dying visions. Unsatisfied, he turns on the other inhabitants of the mission, including the Indian woman he once loved. Can anyone stop "the King of Terrors" before it is too late?

####June 18th

Staged reading of Arches, Balance and Light by [Mary J Spletter](http://www.shewrites.com/profile/MaryJSpletter)
Directed by [Lucinda Z. Alipio](http://www.timelinetheatre.com/bios/alipio_lucinda.htm)

Julia Morgan is one of California's most remarkable architects, designing more than 700 buildings including Hearst Castle. In her first play, Arches, Balance and Light, Mary Spletter combines historical fact with her own fantasy explanation of how this elusive and private individual designed her own success---one brick at a time.

####June 25th

Developmental reading of Les Fantômes by [Chris Holbrook](http://foiepas.com/crew.html)

Will, a struggling writer in his early 40s, moves to Paris in the wake of a messy separation from his wife. Yet the more he tries to move on with his life, the more the specter of his ex-wife and his failed marriage haunts him. To help him, Guillaume, his best friend, sets him up on a blind date—a seemingly innocent evening that leads to an explosive confrontation with his own past and present.

###Emotional Creature

Emotional Creature by [Eve Ensler](http://www.vday.org/about/more-about/eveensler) at [Berkeley Repertory Theatre](http://www.berkeleyrep.org/season/1112/5846.asp) JUNE 14–JULY 15, 2012

Berkeley Rep is proud to present the world premiere of a powerful new play from Tony Award-winner Eve Ensler. Staged by Obie Award-winning director [Jo Bonney](http://broadwayworld.com/people/Jo-Bonney/) and performed by a talented ensemble of young women, Emotional Creature is made up of original monologues—and irresistible songs—about and for girls. Placing their stories squarely center stage, it gives full expression to their secret voices and innermost thoughts, highlighting the diversity and commonality of the issues they face. Emotional Creature is a call, a reckoning, an education, an act of empowerment for girls, and an illumination for parents and for us all. And it’s receiving its world premiere here at Berkeley Rep.

###Crevice

Crevice by [Lauren Yee](http://laurenyee.com/) at [Impact Theatre](http://www.impacttheatre.com/season/index.php), directed by [Desdemona Chiang](http://www.impacttheatre.com/about/desdemona.php) MAY 3–JUNE 9

Liz and Rob, siblings in their late 20s, are stuck. Liz, an overachiever, was recently jilted; Rob, technically an actor, has little motivation; both are back at home, more or less glued to the couch. Kathleen, their mother, has recently taken up with her real estate agent, who's helping her sell her the family home. And while the earth moves under Kathleen's bed, another geological event is happening in the living room: a huge crevice opens up beneath the couch. First Rob is sucked in, then Liz. In the crevice world, a cracked-mirror replica of our own, anyone can seemingly have anything they want. But is that really a good idea? As in her 2008 smash hit Ching Chong Chinaman, Lauren Yee takes the audience on hilarious and unexpected twists and turns with a healthy dose of magical realism.

###SO...

To sum things up, get out there! See exciting new theatre! Trust me, it's better than doing nothing. I used to do nothing all the time, it's overrated.
