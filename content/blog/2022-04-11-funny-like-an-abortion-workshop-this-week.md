Bay Area, I will be seeing you so very soon! Tomorrow will kick off the workshop of [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) with [PlayGround](https://playground-sf.org/)! The workshop is working towards a developmental production during [PlayGround's Festival of New Works this coming May](https://playground-sf.org/festival/). I am over the moon excited to work this week, and to get the play up on its feet for two nights in May and see how it does in front of a live audience!

*Funny, Like An Abortion* will run May 28th and 29th, 2022, at Potrero Stage in San Francisco, Ca. And you can reserve your tickets now, and you really should, [right here](https://playground-sf.org/funnylikeanabortion/)! Directed by Giovanna Sardelli, with Bay Area super-stars Rosie Hallett and Isabel To. I will be back out and in person for the performances, hope I get the chance to share this play with you in person, or online (yes, it's streaming too and you can get those tickets in the same spot [here](https://playground-sf.org/funnylikeanabortion/)!).

Happy Monday!
