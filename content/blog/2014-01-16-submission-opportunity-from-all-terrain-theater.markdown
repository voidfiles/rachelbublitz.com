[All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/)'s solo showcase Women In Solodarity is gearing up for it's third year! If you'd like to be involved, we're currently accepting submissions, here is everything you need to know:

All Terrain Theater is producing its third annual Women in Solodarity showcase and we're soliciting scripts from female writers related to the theme of Modern Lovers: Women and Technology. 

This showcase was formed in 2012 to counterbalance the overwhelming over-representation of men's stories in theater and other media and to create opportunities for female artists to present and perform their stories. The showcase features solo performance pieces (plays with multiple characters all performed by the same actor), monologues, and solo storytelling. The production is performed at a private residence in Berkeley, CA in association with the International Home Theater Festival.

We invite writers to submit an original script related to the theme of Modern Lovers: Women and Technology with a performance time of approximately 5 to 20 minutes (generally between 1-8 pages, depending on formatting; please read your script aloud and time it before submitting). Prior performance or publication of the submitted piece(s) is okay. Writers should be based in the San Francisco Bay Area and must be available for at least one performance, and preferably for at least one rehearsal in April or May. Writers who have had work previously produced through this series are asked to refrain from submitting this year. 

Please submit your script as a PDF document to [submissions@allterraintheater.org](mailto:submissions@allterraintheater.org) by Saturday, February 15, 2014.

Please indicate if you are also an actor who wishes to perform the submitted piece.

Submitted scripts will be reviewed by our director and producer to fill approximately three of the remaining slots in our production. Writers will be notified of whether their script was selected by the end of February for production in May 2014. Rehearsals begin in April and we intend to host at least five public performances. Selected writers receive a share of ticket sales.

All Terrain Theater is an independent theater company dedicated to producing original, entertaining, and accessible work that gives artists a chance to explore and develop their craft. We are committed to representing women as artists as well as characters in our stories and we strive to create an environment that embraces a wide variety of audiences by telling as many of their stories as possible.

Our first Women in Solodarity showcase was themed "It's a Woman's World" and featured powerful and masterfully performed pieces addressing topics ranging from pregnancy to aging, surviving cancer, and growing up black in the South. Last year's uber-popular "Cat Ladies" showcase sold out five performances and two extensions and featured seven funny and poignant pieces about cats, women's relationships with cats, and women and their inner feline.
