title: A Look Back At 2013
---

2013 is over! 2014 is here! How do you feel about that? I feel pretty great. 2013 was a very exciting year for me. I had a public reading or production in each month of 2013 except for October. That's pretty exciting. I also directed for the first time in years, and I dipped my toes into producing as well. I also got rejected, accepted, and started grad school, which is a funny story all in itself (remember? [Rejected from SFSU's MFA program](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2013/03/28/rejected-from-sfsus-mfa-program/) followed by [The Clerical Error](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2013/04/08/the-clerical-error/)). Lots of ups and downs in the theatre world, but also in my other worlds. My kids and I are figuring out my MFA schedule, it's an adjustment going from 24/7 mom to mom being away two nights a week and having homework. But in the ups section, [*Audrey Scare People Play*](http://rrachelbublitz.com/blog/2013/03/03/audreys-play-is-blowing-up/) happened in 2013! Audrey learned to read in 2013. And Jonah is starting to preform around the house (he's like a human sound effect machine), and it's great to see him blossoming now that Audrey's away at kindergarten. OH! And also in 2013, I got all A's for my first semester at SFSU! Woo!

So, all and all, 2013 was all right with me, and with 2014 coming after, I have pretty high hopes.
