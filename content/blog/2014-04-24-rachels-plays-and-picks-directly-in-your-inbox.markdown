You know what's great? Theater, and lots of it.

If you find yourself wishing you knew about *more* theater, especially theater written by me and/or theater that I don't think can be missed, sign up for my brand-spanking newsletter!

It's fancy. You should totally do it. And you can do it right here:

<form style="border:1px solid #ccc;padding:3px;text-align:center;" action="https://tinyletter.com/rachelbublitz" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://tinyletter.com/rachelbublitz', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true"><p><label for="tlemail">Enter your email address</label></p><p><input type="text" style="width:140px" name="email" id="tlemail" /></p><input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed"/><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" /><p><a href="https://tinyletter.com" target="_blank">powered by TinyLetter</a></p></form>

PS, this fancy sign up is NOT going to show up on facebook, so click through to my website to get the goods.

If you're wondering what my PLAYS and PICKS for May are, don't hesitate to sign up!

Or sign up anyway.... Because you're a kind person.
