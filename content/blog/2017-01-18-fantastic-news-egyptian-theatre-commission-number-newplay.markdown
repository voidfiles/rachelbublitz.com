title: 'Fantastic News: Egyptian Theatre Commission! #newplay'
---

Are you ready to hear the fantastic news of the day? Great! Yesterday I signed the contract making a commission from the [Egyptian Theatre](http://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) official! One of the 6 plays I'll be writing this year will be silly, campy, and packed with girl power, and it'll be titled: CHEERLEADERS VS ALIENS. Yep, you read right. Cheerleaders fighting aliens. Last year I decided that I wanted to tackle a full length play for high school kids so I starting thinking about a play I'd have liked to have had the option of doing when I was a young theater nerd, and fighting aliens, or playing an alien was the obvious answer. 

I'll be writing the play this Spring with a week long workshop scheduled with the Egyptian Youtheatre for this summer. The play is already scheduled to be produced in the Spring of 2018. Can you imagine? A play that's still just a thought in my head *has been scheduled for production*! I'm thrilled and excited and I can't wait to get to cracking on this sci-fi adventure. 

Now with the beans good and spilled I've got to get back to writing, don't know if you noticed but I'm a little busy this year.
