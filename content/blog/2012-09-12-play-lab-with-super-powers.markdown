title: Play Lab With Super Powers
---

While reading over [NYC Playwrights Blog](http://nycp.blogspot.com/) this evening, I was struck by one of the calls for submissions. It's for a short play lab in October... And apparently they have the ability to read and decide on plays *before you send them in*!

Under the "easy-peasy" rules, they state:

>"Deadline is Oct. 7. Notification will be immediately after submission, if not sooner."

I'm going to repeat that in case you didn't catch it... "Notification will be immediately after submission, *if not sooner*." They will evaluate your script and notify you on the outcome *before* you even submit it! Nice, huh? Saves time, more companies should seriously consider taking advantage of magical abilities.
