title: Only 5 Performances For THE FANTASY CLUB Left
---

Last night was opening night for *The Fantasy CLub* and the audience loved the show! I can now breathe normally again. But, there are only 5 remaining shows, and as they get closer they get more heavily sold. If you want to see *The Fantasy Club* I highly recommend buying your tickets in advance! Tonight we have room for walk-ups, but last night we were at capacity! Hope to see you tonight!

Buy your tickets!
