+++

Yesterday I had the BEST meeting with Jamie Wilcox, the [Egyptian Youtheatre](http://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) Director, and Alicia Washington, Founder and Co-Director for [Good Company Theatre](https://www.goodcotheatre.com/). I am SO pumped to announce to the world that Alicia Washington will be directing not only the summer workshop of *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*, but also the world premiere production next Spring! I walked away from that meeting bouncing with excitement guys.

Also discussed at the meeting, this summer we'll have a dramaturg for our workshop! Eeeeeeeee! So not only do I get to work with a new awesome director, I ALSO get to work with a new awesome dramaturg. Color me one happy playwright. Megan Crivello will join us for our week-long workshop up in Park City this July and let me tell you, July can't come quick enough!

Now I've gotta run and actually write this script. More soon!
