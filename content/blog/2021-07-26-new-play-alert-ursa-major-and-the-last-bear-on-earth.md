Do you ever feel jam-packed busy but also like you've done nothing at all? That's been my consistent status since March of 2020, and I don't' think I'm alone. But, I have to remind myself that even if I'm still not operating at my normal pace, I'm still getting things done. You want some proof? How about new plays!

I've been interested in radio plays for a long, long time, and I've finally ventured into creating not just one, but an entire series! I intend to write a total of twelve radio plays, all inspired by constellations, and all intended for high school and middle school performers. The series will be called *The Night Sky Radio Plays* and it is my hope to one day publish them all in one big ol' collection one of these days.

The first of the twelve, [*Ursa Major & the Last Bear on Earth*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1523513/ursa-major-last-bear-earth) is hot off the presses and up on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1523513/ursa-major-last-bear-earth)! I'll be working on the next eleven over the coming months. Please give it a read, if you're interested, just keep in mind it's a first draft!

And that's not all, last month I finished the first draft of my commission from [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/), [*The Book Women*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1355959/book-women), which you can ALSO read on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1355959/book-women) right now, this very moment.

I have to keep reminding myself, even on days like today, when I'm bogged down by dishes and laundry and the desire to just sit in front of the TV and zone out to the Olympics, I'm still able to get some stuff done.

Stay tuned for a *very* exciting announcement that I have had to bite my tongue in order to keep. It hurts. A lot.

Happy Monday!
