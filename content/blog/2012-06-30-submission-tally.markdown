title: I'm Back And Submission Tally
---

I am home from my weeks in lovely Italy. I had a wonderful time. And I even got (a very small) bit of playwrighting done! I did some fixing up of "The Fantasy Club" and I'm getting very excited about the ending. Brace yourselves, my protagonist might actually end up learning something! Didn't know how I was going to work that in, and then on one of my very early mornings (couldn't sleep because of the time change), I took advantage of my alone time and got to work. I'm very much looking forward to the scene nights this July, I need to hear how everything sounds out loud! It's almost time for me to find a production I think. I'm very excited about that.

My submission tally is up to 63. I'm still behind, but I'm feeling confident I'll catch up. I'm planning on attempting the [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/playwrightbinge/) this September (submitting a play a day). AND after [The 31 Plays in 31 Days Project](http://31plays31days.com) this August I'll have a bunch of new material to send around. 

So, to sum it all up.... I'm very excited to be home and jump back in. And keep tuning in, I have a possible new full length I've been stewing over....
