title: 'Saturday Shout Out: Tracy Held Potter'
---

A new feature! Come back on Saturdays to hear about an exciting person in theatre! It might be someone I know here in the Bay Area, it might be someone I admire, or if I'm feeling especially energized, I just might have more than one! This week, for my inaugural shout out, I'm going to start with my other-half, [Tracy Held Potter](https://www.facebook.com/TracyHeldPotter?fref=ts).

Tracy is the Executive Director for [Play Cafe](http://www.playcafe.org/), an organization that helps playwright hear their works in a monthly scene night in Berkeley (the second Thursday of the month, bring $10, and 10 pages or less!), the Artistic Director of [All Terrain Theater Co.](http://www.allterraintheater.org/), and Co-Founder of the [31 Plays in 31 Days Project](http://31plays31days.com/). On top of these huge titles and the duties that go with them, she has two children, and writes! She's currently working on a full length play, two short plays commissioned by [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/), and several short plays for our [SF Fringe](http://www.sffringe.org/wordpress/) show [Babies: The Ultimate Birth Control](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2013/02/27/photos-from-babies-the-ultimate-birth-control-coming-this-fall-with-the-sf-fringe-fest/). Her plays are thoughtful, thought provoking,   subtle, and honest. 

Oh, and she also directs! AND she was recently accepted into the screen, stage, and television MFA program at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml)! She is a force that won't be stopped, and I am lucky to have such an awesome and strong woman to look up to. If you'd like to know more about Tracy, go to her [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TracyHeldPotter?fref=ts) and click "like," then you'll get updates from her in your news feed. 

I had to start with Tracy, but who will I be calling your attention to next week? It's a mystery! Come back next Saturday and find out.
