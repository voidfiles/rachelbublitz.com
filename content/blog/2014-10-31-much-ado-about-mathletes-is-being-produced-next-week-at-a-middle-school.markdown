title: MUCH ADO ABOUT MATHLETES is being produced next week at a middle school
---

In other fun news, my one-act *Much Ado About Mathletes* is being produced next Wednesday and Thursday at Redwood Day School in Oakland! I wrote the play with high school and middle school in mind, so I'm very excited to see it in it's intended habitat. 

And hey, if you're a high school or middle school teacher looking for material, send me an email ([Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com))! I'd love for more students to do this play.

For now, enjoy your weekend, enjoy Halloween, and keep working those math drills, you never know when they'll come in handy.
