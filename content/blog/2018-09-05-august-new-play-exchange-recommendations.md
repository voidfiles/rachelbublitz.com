I did not read and recommend a ton of play last month on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard), but I thoroughly enjoyed the ones that I did! Here's a list of my August recommendations, please read, recommend, and PRODUCE these plays in a theater near me...

["*Stand*" by Matthew Ivan Bennett](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/193811/stand)  
["*Little Happy Secrets*" by Melissa Leilani Larson](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2969/little-happy-secrets)  
["*Temp*" by Nicholas Dunn](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/108748/temp)  
["*Missives*" by Elizabeth A. M. Keel](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/197103/missives)  
["*BUG STUDY*" by Emma Goldman-Sherman](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/28091/bug-study)  
["*Storm Clouds for Lonely Hearts*" by Quinn Xavier Hernandez](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/132316/storm-clouds-lonely-hearts)  
["*A Murder of Crows*" by Lee Lawing](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/199141/murder-crows)  

I'm very excited to be back to my normal schedule which allows for more reading. It is so INSPIRING and ENCOURAGING to have so many INCREDIBLE new plays at my fingertips. If you haven't given it a try, come on and jump on this train (and start with the great plays listed above)!

Happy Wednesday!
