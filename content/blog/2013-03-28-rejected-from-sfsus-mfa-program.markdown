title: Rejected From SFSU's MFA Program
---

Biggest rejection of my life so far; my application was rejected from SFSU and the creative writing MFA program. I found out yesterday, and before you ask, I do not know why... They're sending me a letter via snail mail to let me know. I very much hope that it isn't a form letter...

I'm disappointed for sure, but I'll be fine. Whatever the reason... I'm not going for an MFA, at least not this year. Time to figure some things out...
