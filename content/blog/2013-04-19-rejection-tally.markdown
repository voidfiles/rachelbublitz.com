title: Rejection Tally
---

One of my goals for this year was to obtain 100 rejection letters. Now we're going to play the fun game of counting up my rejections to see how I'm doing so far in reaching 100! PS, I'm totally counting my SFSU rejection because of all the worry it caused.

Okay... Here's the count for this year:

From things I've submitted so far in 2013 I've only gotten 10 rejections. This will be harder than I thought. In case you're curious my work has been selected 4 times and I have a grand total of 66 submissions so far!
