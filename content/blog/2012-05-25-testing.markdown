title: 31 Plays in 31 Days Project
---

Had two wonderful conversations this morning concerning the 31 Plays in 31 Days Project! We'll be launching the website in June, probably close to the beginning (hopefully the 1st). You'll be able to sign up for the challenge of writing 31 Plays in 31 Days, find out what and why we're doing it, and see other ways you can help us out. Right now we need people who'd like to help get this project off the ground and running. Our goal is to make this an international project! 

Interested? Curious? Want to help? Email me questions, or if you'd like to volunteer. At this moment we're three people strong, and could use some extra bodies and minds!

Email me at [Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com). Thanks!
