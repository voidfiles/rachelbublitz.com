I did it!

For this year I will have had a public performance of my work in *every single month*!!!

My wild and crazy #SubmissionMission is to blame of course, at least partly, because I've gotten at least half a dozen requests through folks finding my work on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz) and sending me a requests... And probably also my general habit of throwing caution to the wind and asking for things I want (something I highly recommend!).

Anyway, here's a full list of all the public performances I've had this year and what's still to come:

### January:  
*HAPPILY*, full length, staged reading with [Quantum Dragon Theatre](https://www.quantumdragon.org/)'s Forge Reading Series.

[*MOM'S HAM*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/62099/moms-ham), ten-minute, workshop and reading with [Phoenix Theatre Ensemble](http://www.phoenixtheatreensemble.org/).

*MY BODY*, is by far my most produced and performed play, but *RIPPED* is starting to give it a run for its money, which I'm so excited about considering *RIPPED* is a full-length play. Anyway 2018 has been pretty great for me and my #SubmissionMission. Will my luck keep up in 2019?... We'll just have to wait and see I guess.

Happy Friday everyone!
