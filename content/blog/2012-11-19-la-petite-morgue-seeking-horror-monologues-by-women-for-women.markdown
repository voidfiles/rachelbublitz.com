title: La Petite Morgue Seeking Horror Monologues by Women for Women
---

[La Petite Morgue](http://lapetitemorgue.blogspot.com/) is looking for horror monologues by women for women for Women in Horror Recognition Month (WiHM). Deadline is 12/1. Here's a bit more about what they want from their website:

>"We are particularly interested in monologues that are active (rather than passive story-telling narratives). And while women being terrorized can make for fascinating monologues, we are far more interested in women who stand up to their tormentors - or who are doing the terrorizing themselves. At this time, there is no firm length requirement, but we would prefer pieces that are no more than 3,000 words."

So get on it. 

They are also always on the lookout for horror and suspense plays (no comedies!). [Go here](http://lapetitemorgue.blogspot.com/2012/07/script-submissions.html) for those details.
