title: End Of Year Submission Tally
---

There are 13 days left in the year, crazy, right? I thought this would be a good time to look back on my goals set last year and see how I stack up. On January 2nd, I declared my goals in a post titled, [Submissions](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2012/01/02/submissions/)... Here it is:

>"Looking to 2012 I have some goals (not resolutions). I want to complete another full length play and 4 more short or one act plays. I want to make it to 150 submissions, and Iâ€™d like 10 theatres or publishers to use my work. I would also like to read one play a week."

Let's start with submissions... I wanted to submit a total of 150 times and I.... (insert drumroll)... Submitted a total of 168 times! Woohoo, I made it! I received a total of 54 rejections last year, and 11 theatres/festivals have selected my work (1 over my goal!). 

As far as writing, as you know I wrote a whole lot more than just 4 new short plays (I wrote over 31!), probably around 40, and I completed a draft of a full length (*My Sister's Baby*).

Reading I have not kept up with a new play a week, I admit. I did read over 90 plays in October though... Does that even me out? Hmmm... I wonder.

Anyway, looking at all of this, I'm incredibly pleased with myself and how hard I'm pushing myself. I hope to be more productive next year... Stay tuned for my goals for 2013 (probably posted in early January).
