March is shaping up to be a really big month for me! You have TWO chances now to see plays written by me, and that doesn't happen too often.

FIRST CHANCE:

###[Monday Night PlayGround](https://www.facebook.com/events/1548149155458043/1552877548318537/) at Berkeley Rep, Monday March 16th, 8pm

My ten-minute play *Lean In With Liz!* is joining the line-up for this month's Monday Night PlayGround at Berkeley Rep! The topic we were given last Friday was: "HERSTORY: THE GREATEST STORIES NEVER TOLD" And here's the full line-up:

*Lean In With Liz!* by Rachel Bublitz, directed by Jeffrey Lo

*Street Photographer* by Genne Murphy, directed by Rebecca Ennals

*Epiphany* by Naomi Newman, directed by Jon Tracy

*Feminist Valhalla* by Takeo Rivera, directed by Jim Kleinmann

*Frankenstein's Grandmother* by Steven Westdahl, directed by Chloe Bronzan

*Drifters* by Arisa White, directed by Edris Cooper

It's going to be fun, it's going to be great! You should come. Absolutely come. Here's the facebook invite for all the nitty-gritty details: [https://www.facebook.com/events/1548149155458043/1552877548318537/](https://www.facebook.com/events/1548149155458043/1552877548318537/)

SECOND CHANCE:

###[On The Spot](https://www.facebook.com/events/949045388473769/) with [San Francisco Theater Pub](https://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/)! Running March 23, 24, 30, and 31 at 8pm!

This play I haven't even written yet! Just this morning I got the prompt and after I've finished my laundry, dishes, and made the rice crispy treats for my daughter's class, I'm planning on sitting down and banging it out. How I love a good time crunch. I'll be writing for two fantastic actors: Jan Gilbert and AJ Davenport, and super excited to be working with a brand new director, Sam Tillis! 

Here's a list of all the playwrights involved: Jake Arky, Gabriel Bellman & Sara Judge, Rachel Bublitz, Barry Eitel, Seanan Palmero, and Madeline Puccioni!
