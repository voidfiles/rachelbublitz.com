title: Finishing Up Binge
---

It was a tedious road, but I am happy to say that I have completed this binge! Is it just me, or does each new month seem busier than the last? I'm scared of starting April...

Anyway, here are my last seven submissions:

Submission number 25, I sent my ten minute play *Baby Pie* to [Black Ship Theatre Co.](http://www.blackshipco.org/play-submissions). They're looking for short plays and full length plays, for main stage productions and for a series called Black Curtain Submissions. They'd like plays that fit within this:

>"For this season, we're seeking plays with a touch of the absurd, imaginary, or the magical. We're talking everything from tall tales & urban legends to new myths & folk heroes."

I sent in *My Body* to [The Collective](http://thecollective-ny.org/submissions.html) for their short play showcase. They want ten minute plays that fit within their mission statement:

>"The Collective unites professional artists who share a responsibility to create work in the contemporary American Theatre that is emotionally truthful, socially relevant, and defiantly accessible."

[Gi60](http://www.gi60.blogspot.com/) or Gone in 60 Seconds, a one minute play festival, seeks plays that are one minute long. You may submit as many one minute plays as you'd like, but they must all be sent in separate emails. I sent in three; *Flee*, *Dealing With Death*, and *Not Pregnant*.

And finally, for submissions 30 and 31, I sent plays into [ICBNS](http://icbins.com/2013/03/19/icbins-opens-submissions-for-reading-series-night-of-ten-minute-plays/). They're looking for short and funny plays for a short play series, as well as plays of any length for a staged reading series. For the staged reading series they want comedies, or fringe-themed plays; fantasy, horror, or sc-fi. I sent in *Nap Time* as well as *My Sister's Baby*.

That brings me up to 31! Yes! Done. Now to the other 100 things I have to do today......
