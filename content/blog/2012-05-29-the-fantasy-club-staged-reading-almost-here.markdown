title: THE FANTASY CLUB staged reading almost here!
---

We are days away from the staged reading of "The Fantasy Club!" It's happening this coming Monday, June 4th at 7:30 at the Off Market Theatre in San Francisco. You can visit [THE FANTASY CLUB Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/284394794968889/) for all of the details. Make sure and RSVP!

Now that I'm done with my rewrites, I get to spend the day wrestling with my printer, hoping it will obey me and print off 7 copies of my 93 page script! Trees, I apologize, I wish that there was an easier way. I'm about to go to [Cartridge World](http://www.cartridgeworld.com/usa/usa197/) in Oakland and get my printer more juice, and then it's print, print, print, hole punch x 100, and hope my toddler doesn't decide to wander through and destroy everything. Wish me luck!
