title: Submission Tally
---

At the start of this year I gave myself the (maybe impossible?) task of submitting 365 times this year. And I kept up with it until this summer, where turbulence hit in the form of three major projects happening at once; *Iro*, *The Red House Monster*, and my first ever screen play, *Girl Friend*. Since then life and grad school have been getting in the way of me catching up, but I have high hopes that I'll make it (probably).

Anyway, since it's the beginning of the month, I thought I'd catch you up... For the month of September I submitted 32 times! Which brings my yearly total up to 243! Oy vey. That's a whole lot of submissions, but not quite enough. It's day 278 today, so that makes me 35 submissions behind. Think I'll make it up? I'll certainly try! Maybe I should start taking bets.
