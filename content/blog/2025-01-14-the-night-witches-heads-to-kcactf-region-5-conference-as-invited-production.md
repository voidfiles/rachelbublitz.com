A production of [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches) by the [University of Northwestern St. Paul](https://www.unwsp.edu/events/the-night-witches-the-amazing-true-story-of-how-russian-women-pilots-helped-win-wwii/) is headed to the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival Region 5 Conference kicking off January 19th in Des Moines, Iowa as an invited production! Having participated in a few KCACTF Conferences as a playwriting grad student, and once as an invited artists, I couldn't be happier to continue a bit of involvement. I know I won't be there, but my work will be, which is the next best thing!

Sending the students and faculty involved in this production my hearty congratulations! Neither fluff, or feather!
