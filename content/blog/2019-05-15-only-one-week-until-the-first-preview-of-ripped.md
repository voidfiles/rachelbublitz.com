SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!  
THERE'S ONLY ONE WEEK UNTIL THE FIRST PREVIEW OF [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) AT [Z SPACE](http://www.zspace.org/)!   
I'm not yelling, you're yelling. Well, maybe I am yelling, but just a little.... Only because THERE'S ONLY ONE WEEK UNTIL THE FIRST PREVIEW! That's seven days. That's 178-ish hours! I am so proud to share this play. And to have its World Premiere with an amazing place like Z Space is unbelievable. Nothing would make me happier than packing the house each and every performance.

First preview is Wednesday May 22nd (that's just in ONE week!), and we open Saturday May 25th, running through Saturday June 15th. If you're looking to save some $$$ on your ticket, please take advantage of these discount codes:

"LUCY" for $5 off any ticket during the run.

"FIRSTLOOK" for a $5 ticket to any preview performance (May 22nd, 23rd, or 24th).

So............  
HAVE YOU BOUGHT YOUR TICKETS YET??? You can do that right here: [www.zspace.org/rippedshow](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow)

Hope to see you at Z Space!  
(In just *one* week!)
