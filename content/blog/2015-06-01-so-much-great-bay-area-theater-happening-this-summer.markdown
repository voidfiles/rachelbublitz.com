title: SO Much GREAT Bay Area Theater Happening This Summer!
---

This morning I sat down to look at my calendar and suffered a panic attack realizing how many amazing things are happening this summer here in the Bay Area. It might seem like it's a good thing to outsiders (really, it is) but I can't make it to everything, hence the heaving and wheezing and general spazing out of my mind and body. OY! Why can't I make copies of myself or build a time machine. WHY? 

Well, I might just look into those things, but in the meantime, I think this means that YOU have to go see things in my absence. Yep, that is the ONLY way we're going to work all this out. I'll see what I can see, you see everything else, and we'll meet for coffee and catch one another up, okay? OKAY? You need to go with me on this or the hyperventilating is going to start back up.

What great stuff is happening? SO glad you asked, because here's (insert drumroll, please):

###Shotgun Players presents: HEART SHAPED NEBULA by Written by  Marisela Treviño Orta, directed by  Desdemona Chiang

Confined in the attic of an old, dilapidated mansion, as part of a “rest cure” prescribed by her husband, “Jane” begins to see strange forms creeping around behind the torn and ragged yellow wallpaper in the room."

###The Breadbox presents: THE PILLOWMAN by Martin McDonagh, directed by Ariel Craft

Running June 12 - June 27 at EXIT Theatre in SF!

>"Life imitates art in this comedy so dark you'll wish you had a flashlight. This Olivier Award winning turn from Irish playwright McDonagh follows Katurian, prolific author of fairy tales more twisted than the Grimms', as his entire life unravels before him over the course of a single day. Someone’s been torturing and murdering local children in step with Katurian's fiction and the writer himself will have to answer for their deaths. "The Pillowman" is a fearless exploration of our capacities for cruelty, a culture of police brutality, and the far-reaching impact of our own creations."

Seriously, [The Breadbox](http://www.breadboxtheatre.org/) puts on some fantastic shows, and Ariel Craft is one of my favorite directors.

###All Terrain Theater presents: Women in Solodarity: Waking Up, directed by Chelsey Little

>"Open your eyes, look into yourself, and WAKE UP to the power of solo female performance. “Waking Up!” features works by female playwrights and solo performers about finding yourself, discovering truth, and knowing that, at some point, the masks we all wear will have to come off."

Women in Solodarity has a habit of selling out, so don't wait to get your ticket for this!

###Aurora Theatre presents: DETROIT by Lisa D’Amour, directed by Josh Costello

Running June 19 - July 19 at Aurora Theatre in Berkeley!

>"Lisa D’Amour’s Detroit, a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize, is a wickedly funny satire about our uncertain, deflating economic times. Barely middle class Ben and Mary fire up the grill to welcome Sharon and Kenny, a couple who moves in next door (suspiciously without furniture). But as this foursome bonds over backyard barbecues, remembered dreams and helping hands, their neighborly connection turns dangerous, threatening to destroy more than just their friendship."

True story, I just read this play a few weeks ago, and I was thought, "Man oh man, I *really* want to see this done!" And then the next day I saw that Aurora was about to open the show just a mile from my place! I really can't wait for this one.

###DIVAfest presents: Loud & Unladylike Festival

Readings June 25 - 27, and July 9 - 11 at the EXIT Theatre in SF!

Brand-spanking-new plays by Claire Rice, Tracy Held Potter, and me! This is going to be so, so, so, so great. We're getting ready to announce our casts AND the writers for the 2016 festival! Here are the dates of each play:

*A is for Adeline* by Tracy Held Potter (6/25 & 7/9)

*The Effects of Ultraviolet Light* by Claire Ann Rice (6/25 & 7/11)

*Code Name: Brass Rose* by Rachel Bublitz (6/27 & 7/11)

There will be a talkback after each reading, AND the writers will be making edits in between the two presentations, so you might want to come to all of the performances so you can see what we kept and what we threw away.

So buy, buy, buy yourself a seat. Or two. Or ten, you have a lot of friends, right?

###Killing My Lobster presents: KML Gets a Prenup!

June 26 and 27 at PianoFight in SF!

>"We know – you’ve already gotten a million invites to weddings this Summer. Half of them are out of state, and if you go to one more wedding with a cash bar, you might kill the Universal Life Church Officiant. We cordially invite you to a night of comedy focused on just how ridiculous the wedding season can get! (KML is registered at CVS Pharmacies, but your presence is the real present.)"

Killing My Lobster is great. If you haven't seen one of their shows since Millie DeBenedet and Allison Page took over, stop torturing yourself. 

Tickets: [http://www.eventbrite.com/e/killing-my-lobster-kml-gets-a-prenup-tickets-15206331547?ref=ebtnebtckt](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/killing-my-lobster-kml-gets-a-prenup-tickets-15206331547?ref=ebtnebtckt)

###Custom Made Theatre Co. presents the San Francisco premiere of GREY GARDENS: THE MUSICAL book by Doug Wright, music by Scott Frankel, and lyrics by Michael Korie, directed by Stuart Bousel

Running now through July 5th at Gough Street Playhouse in SF!

>"Based on a true story, Grey Gardens is a musical exploration of the American dream gone wrong and what it means to become a social pariah. It's also an exploration of women, the relationship between mothers and daughters, how love can turn into dependency, and how, in a society where women's roles and options are limited, particularly in the aristocratic class, the very things that make one exceptional could ultimately be what damns them to a life in decay and shadows.  Featuring an intimate, musical score that borrows as much from Stephen Sondheim as the eras in which it is set, Grey Gardens is the perfect chamber musical that will use the intimacy of Gough Street Playhouse to haunt as well as delight." 

So far I have heard only FABULOUS things about this production, and they're selling so well they've already put in an extension. My recommendation? Buy those tickets ASAP!

##JULY

###No Nude Men presents: DESK SET by William Marchant, directed by Stuart Bousel

Running July 9 - 25 at the EXIT Theatre in SF.

>"Dusted off and polished-up, this clever comedy about four women researchers who find their careers threatened by technological advancements that produce a machine capable of replacing them is surprisingly relevant, touching on everything from gender roles in the workplace to the ever changing expectations of professionals in the post tech-boom world. Though No Nude Men keeps the comedy in its 1950s setting, it won't be hard for today's audiences to draw the connections that make this piece more of the moment than ever. Add in more than a dash of retro kitsch, including nightly games and drink specials, and there's no question this will be a show everyone is talking about! 

>"Featuring a stellar cast of local actors: Megan Briggs, Andrew Calabrese, Alan Coyne, Lisa Drostova, Abhi Kris, Allison Page, Carina Lastimosa Salazar, Marissa Skudlarek, Jeunee Simon, Alejandro Torres, Kitty Torres, Nick Trengove."

This cast. THIS CAST! Yeah, *Desk Set* is going to be killer.

###Saturday Write Fever

Join SF Theater Pub at the Cafe at EXIT Theatre every 2nd Saturday of the month to create and watch the newest theater you'll ever see preformed (probably). 

>"It all takes place in the EXIT Cafe (156 Eddy Street) from 8:30-8:50 pm for registration, followed by a 9:00 pm writing sprint where writers have 30 minutes (more or less) to script original monologues based around that night’s pre-generated prompts. We cast actors from the crowd (no experience necessary), then at 9:30 pm, they perform the work on stage in the café for an on-the-spot, one-night-only, instant festival! Come join in the communal creativity, either as writer, performer, or audience!"

This is one of my favorite Saturday night activities, it should be one of yours as well! For more info, visit the Facebook event page for the next SWF: [https://www.facebook.com/events/477929019038762/](https://www.facebook.com/events/477929019038762/)

So there you have it, I'll take some, you take some, we'll meet and fill one another in on what we missed, yes? And don't worry, the fun isn't coming to a stop, because once we're done with Summer, we'll have the SF Fringe Festival!
