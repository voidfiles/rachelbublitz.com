title: The Time Is, Now THE FANTASY CLUB Opens Tonight
---

*The Fantasy Club* opens tonight! Will I see you there? I do hope I will! We're very close to be sold out for tonight (I think we have a handful of tickets for walk-up sales), but there are still tickets for the rest of the weekend and next weekend! I'm thinking we may sell out next week, so if I were you I'd get on the advance ticket bus now and pick your tickets up now!

So, get with it and buy tickets for *The Fantasy Club* now!
