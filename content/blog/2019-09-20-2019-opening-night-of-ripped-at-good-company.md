It's the day of the show y'all!

[*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) opens its Utah Premiere tonight with [Good Company Theatre](https://www.goodcotheatre.com/) in Ogden! I was really impressed with dress rehearsal Wednesday night, and I can't wait to see how the show has grown in the in between.

>"Lucy, a freshman in college, is torn between her excitement about the new people in her life and having to leave her old life and loves behind. As she struggles to find a balance between the new and the old, a sexual encounter leaves her confused and concerned that she may have been a victim of rape. The play moves back and forth through time and space as Lucy tries to piece together the unraveling interactions between herself and the two young men sheâ€™s torn between, illuminating the events behind her uncertainty and sparking questions regarding consent."

And while *RIPPED* grapples with consent and date rape, it's balanced with comedy and a few truly tender moments. It's a messy, sweet, challenging, funny play, like life. And I hope you will come out to see it.

Directed by Nicole Finney, and starring Cal Crnich (Jared), Tristan Johnson (Bradley), and Sydnie Schwarzwalder (Lucy).

We will run tonight through October 6th, Fridays and Saturdays at 8pm, with 2pm shows on Saturdays, and 4pm shows on Sundays.
