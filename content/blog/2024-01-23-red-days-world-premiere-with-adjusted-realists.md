The new production news just keeps coming! My full-length play about air quality in the Salt Lake Valley, [*Red Days*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232234/red-days), will receive its World Premiere this Summer with [Adjusted Realists](https://www.adjustedrealists.com/) in New York City! This production will be a collaboration with Weber State University, where *Red Days* will receive a reading next month.

I'll be posting specific dates for the production as soon as they're official,  it's most likely to open in early June, as well as other info! Check back for more details!
