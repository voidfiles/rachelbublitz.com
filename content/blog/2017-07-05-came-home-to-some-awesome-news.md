I have returned to the United States! Australia was amazing. In my ten days there, I caught a play and a circus, ate some delicious food, and held and/or pet a koala, a kangaroo, a wombat, and a crocodile. I feel incredibly accomplished.

The cherry on top of my amazing vacation cake was returning home to find out that my ten minute play *REALLY ADULT* is a finalist for [Actors Theatre of Louisville](https://actorstheatre.org/)'s 2017 Heideman Award!!!!!!!!!!!! I've been submitting to this competition for a few years, and this is my first time cracking into being a finalist. I find out next February if my *REALLY ADULT* has been selected. I wonder how long is too long to cross your fingers, from like, a medical standpoint... I guess I'm going to find out!
