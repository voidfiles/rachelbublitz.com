Last week I headed to Long Beach for water polo (again), but I left a few days before the team to catch a new play by [Brian James Polak](https://www.brianjamespolak.com/), [*The Call List*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2006140/the-call-list) at [The Garage Theatre](https://www.thegaragetheatre.org/), *and* to be interviewed by Brian who hosts [The Subtext](https://www.americantheatre.org/category/audio/the-subtext/) for [American Theatre Magazine](https://www.americantheatre.org/)! Olympus, my son's water polo team, won all of their games, *The Call List* was fantastic, and I had an absolute blast chatting with Brian about theater and my road to playwriting. In all the ways an incredibly successful long weekend in Southern California!

If you're near Long Beach, or don't mind a haul for good theater, be sure to check out Brian's play at The Garage. I was really impressed with everything; the script, the direction, the acting, the set! They really took advantage of their performance space in fun ways. One person shows are hard, and everyone involved really rose to the challenge. [Find tickets here](https://web.ovationtix.com/trs/cal/553), and be quick about it! *The Call List*, starring Bekah Martinez, is quickly selling out its entire run!

And be sure to listen to mine and Brian's chat!! No travel required. [Listen here](https://www.americantheatre.org/2025/05/06/the-subtext-rachel-bublitz-is-writing-for-her-younger-self/), or on [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-subtext/id1336692606) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2HToPqMuDIgK8pgqBpi5vO). I'm working myself up to listening to it myself. Is there anyone out there that can stomach the sound of their own voice?

Happy Wednesday!
