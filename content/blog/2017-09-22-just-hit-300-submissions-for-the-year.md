In other kicking-butt-and-taking-no-prisoners news, I just hit 300 submissions for the year! I've gotten 29 submissions out this month, and adding that to my end of August count (which was 271), I've hit a huge #submissionmission milestone. Now I've only got 100 more to go to reach 400 for the year! Woooo! 

Now I'm off to dip some apples in honey with my loved ones and celebrate Rosh Hashanah. L'Shana Tova!!
