So much good news today!

Very excited to announce that the application for [*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches) to join the [2019 Great Salt Lake Fringe Festival](http://greatsaltlakefringe.org/apply/) was approved! We're going to the Fringe, baby!

It's been a goal of the [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre)'s artistic director, Jamie Wilcox, to take a show on the road for some time now, so when I pitched *THE NIGHT WITCHES* the plan was to bring it down to Salt Lake in some fashion. I've been writing the show with a simple set in mind, not knowing exactly where this on-the-road production would take place. The Great Salt Lake Fringe Festival was our number one choice to make a traveling show happen, and we are ecstatic that we made it in!

After the weeklong workshop this July we will jump straight into auditions, then casting, and a few days later rehearsals. We'll have two weeks to get the show ready with the Fringe, which kicks off August 1st. I won't have specific dates or a venue for a bit, but you better believe I will announce that loud and clear once I know all those details.

The reading this week went so well, it was great to hear my new pages and to get a sense of where I need to focus my attention to get ready for the workshop. I can't wait to dive in and kick this script into shape during the workshop with my brilliant director, Andra Harbold, and our fantastic stage manager, Sammee Jackman. It's a total dream team! 

Stay tuned for more info about this world premiere production!

Is it summer yet???
