TONIGHT is the night folks! My brand new play *Iro, Take Heart* is taking the stage for the FIRST time! Commissioned earlier this year by [Custom Made Theatre Co.](http://custommade.org/), *Iro, Take Heart*, tells the story of a little girl's quest to find the winged horse Pegasus. 

I am very happy and very proud to be sharing this new play with the world, I hope that you can join me and be involved with the very important revision process! Hearing the script in front of an audience is super important, it's where I find out what's working and what isn't. So if you're free tonight, come out and see some FREE theater! You won't be sorry.
