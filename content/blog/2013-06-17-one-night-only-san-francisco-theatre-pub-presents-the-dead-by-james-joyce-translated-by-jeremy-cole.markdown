title: 'ONE NIGHT ONLY San Francisco Theatre Pub Presents: THE DEAD by James Joyce,
  translated by Jeremy Cole'
---

[San Francisco Theatre Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/) is back doing that amazing thing they do at [Cafe Royale](http://www.caferoyale-sf.com/), and tonight they present a ONE NIGHT ONLY staged reading of THE DEAD by James Joyce. [Jeremy Cole](http://jeremycole.org/) has a new translation of the work, and tonight is the only night you can see it! I'd recommend getting there early, it's going to be full tonight! Here's a bit more about tonight's show from the [facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/488680637875103/?ref=3):

>"Every year on June 16th, fans of James Joyce celebrate “Bloomsday” – the day upon which the novel Ulysses takes place. But what is to be done on the day after?

>Join us on Monday, June 17th, for San Francisco Theater Pub’s staged reading of Joyce’s famous short story, “The Dead.”

>Performed Reader’s Theater style, this adaptation of The Dead, by our very own Jeremy Cole, ran for six seasons at Hunger Artists Ensemble Theater in Denver, CO.

>The year is 1904. It is a snowy winter’s night in the city of Dublin. Gretta and Gabriel Conroy are among the guests at the Morkan Sisters’ annual dinner on the Feast of the Epiphany and the last day of Christmas. An evening of laughter, music and dance ends in introspection and Gabriel has an epiphany of his own.

>The Theater Pub cast features: Melissa Clason, Siobhan Doherty, Jean Forsman, Cameron Galloway, Heather Kellogg, William Leschber, Theresa Miller, Rhio Ossola, Vince Faso, and Sara Breindel on the harp.

>Admission is, as always, FREE with a suggested donation, and of course, we’ll have Hide Away Blues BBQ there so arrive hungry and get there early to ensure a seat!"

Be there or be square!
