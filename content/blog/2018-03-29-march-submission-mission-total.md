I'm hanging up my submitting hat for the last two days of the month, and the first week of April (vacation!), so I'm posting my numbers for March now...

It's big, guys.

SUPER big.

My total number of submissions sent out for the month of March is........ (a moment while I triple check the math).......... EIGHTY FOUR! That's the most I've ever sent off in a single month. I am not messing around in 2018, not with submissions anyway. That brings my 2018 total up to 180! 

Here's to hoping I can keep it up come April!

Now, time to pack!
