Tonight at 7pm please join me at [Salt Lake Acting Company](https://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/) for a reading of [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst), a part of their [New Play Sounding Series](https://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/new-play-development/new-play-sounding-series). Rehearsals have been killer and I am so happy with my rewrites throughout this process! I cannot wait to share this new play with a theater full (I hope!) of people! And you can be one of those people!! And I really hope you will be.

Here are all the wonderful details:

*BURST* by Rachel Bublitz

>"On the brink of her next round of funding, Sarah Boyd, Founder and CEO of Tactix, must hold her company together through a insistent journalist's questions and glaring doubts thrown her way surrounding the promises her company has made. It's a heavy load, and Sarah knows that she is the only one great enough to bear it."
