That's a picture of an ecstatic little girl. She just learned that her play has gone viral! In fact it was on [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2013/03/02/horrorsf-play-by-a-four-year.html)! I told her that thousands of people have been reading her play, and she smiled from ear to ear. Thanks everyone, you've just made a little girl very happy!

If you do read the story on boing boing, read the comments, they're super awesome.
