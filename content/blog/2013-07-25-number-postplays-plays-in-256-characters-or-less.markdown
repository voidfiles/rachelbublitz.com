title: '#postplays, Plays In 256 Characters Or Less'
---

[31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/) starts LESS than a week. What am I doing in while I wait for August 1st? Well, honestly like 1,000 things... But one of those things is warming up for the challenge on app.net. For the next 5 days playwrights will be writing one #postplay a day and then posting them onto app.net. These are plays with 256 characters or less (and I'm talking about letters and punctuations, not the *people* that are in the play). There have been some great plays posted so far, you should check them out! Here's mine from today:

Giraffe: Did you hear? We're getting another panda. 
 
Lion: (Roars) Are you kidding me?  

G: Once there's a baby, we're screwed.  

L: I don't get it. Why are pandas so damn popular?  

G: They're fat and lazy, people like the familiar, you know?  

 #postplay

The funny thing is that I've had the idea for this play FOR OVER A YEAR! Yeah, so there's that. Anyway, if you're interested in flexing your writing muscles and seeing what all the fuss is about #postplays, here's how you can do it:

* Go to app.net and sign up for a free account by following this link: [http://join.app.net/from/nfmgxkmhdc](http://join.app.net/from/nfmgxkmhdc)
* Follow @31plays31days on app.net.
* Start writing! We're posting a play a day for 5 days!
* And be sure to use the hash tag #postplay (but if you need the characters, donâ€™t worry about this one!).
