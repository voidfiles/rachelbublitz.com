There is SO much happening right now! Tonight and tomorrow are your last chances to catch [San Francisco Theater Pub](https://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com)'s [ON THE SPOT!](https://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/2015/03/23/theater-around-the-bay-we-open-tonight/) and this coming weekend (April 2nd-4th) may be your only chance to see *TO THE MAN WHO SANG BOWIE* with [PianoFight](http://www.pianofight.com/)'s [ShortLived](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/shortlived-round-5-tickets-15752296543?aff=efbevent) competition!

The ON THE SPOT line-up includes new plays by Jake Arky, Gabriel Bellman & Sara Judge, Barry Eitel, Seanan Palmero, Madeline Puccioni, and myself. The directors are Mike Fatum, Neil Higgins, Christine Keating, Charles Lewis III, Rem Myers, and Sam Tillis, and the acting pool includes: Xanadu Bruggers, Andrew Chung, AJ Davenport, Jan Gilbert, Annabelle King, Michelle Navarrete, Annette Roman, Carole Swann, Jess Thomas, Meg Trowbridge, Steven Widow! 

Tomorrow night is closing night, and if you're into following me around, you can catch me there tonight! It's a free event, with a $5 suggested donation. ON THE SPOT starts at 8pm and will be at PianoFight's new venue, [144 Taylor St, San Francisco, CA 94102](https://www.google.com/maps/place/144+Taylor+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94102/@37.7839092,-122.4106652,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x8085808564c8c383:0x84bc39c7fad8337a).

AND I'm competing in the largest audience-judged theater competition. I'm up for THIS WEEKEND ONLY! My play *TO THE MAN WHO SANG BOWIE* will be directed by Devin McNulty, and my awesome cast is  Meredith Terry and Andy Strong. Here's the kicker though, I will be out of town this weekend! Ack! SO, that means my play HAS to make it to the next round in order for me to SEE it. You can help me by going this weekend, seeing my play, and if it makes you laugh, vote it through to the next round! It's going to be a hard round to make it out of, my competition includes: Faultline Theater, Chardonnay, Bill Bivins, David Levine, and Gwen Kingston. So, buy some tickets: [http://www.eventbrite.com/e/shortlived-round-5-tickets-15752296543?aff=efbevent](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/shortlived-round-5-tickets-15752296543?aff=efbevent)! Laugh! And vote! VOTE, VOTE, VOTE! 

ShortLived is playing also at PianoFight! It is running this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. There are performances at 8pm each night, and a bonus performance April 4th at 5pm as well. 

Will *TO THE MAN WHO SANG BOWIE* make it to the next round? Only time and the audience's response will tell.
