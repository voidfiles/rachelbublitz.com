Free theatre? That's too good to be true! Oh, but it is.... [Magic Theatre](http://magictheatre.org/) is holding readings this month at [The Costume Shop](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1117+Market+Street+San+Francisco,+CA&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x8085809b34dc60c3:0x355635793e574a12,1117+Market+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94102&gl=us&ei=SzsYUZmQE4TZigLGrIHoBQ&ved=0CDEQ8gEwAA). Best part is that they are free and open to the public! Other best part? My friend Alysha Oravetz's full length play *Bird in House* will be read on Friday February 22nd at 8pm. I've read it, and it is twisted, dark, and not to be missed.
