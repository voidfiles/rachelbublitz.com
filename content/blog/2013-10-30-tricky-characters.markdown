title: Tricky Characters
---

There are some characters that I write that I instantly understand, these tend to be main characters, and often there's a lot of me in them and that's where the understanding comes from. Or in the case of Achilles and Patroclus in *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* a TON of research was done before I started writing. But sometimes there are characters that you're making up, so it's hard to research them, AND they're essential to something you're working on. For example, I'm working on a long one horror one-act and there's a character in there that's been eluding me for weeks. It's a male character that's just lost his wife, and is the target of a con. Rosie, one of the main characters (and a serial killer) is trying seduce him, steal all his money, and then kill him, and I haven't figured out how the first part of that's going to work. Where will they meet? What will she say? What about her will trap him? Because that's what Rosie does, like a spider she traps her victims (she uses her guile instead of a web). So that's where I'm at with this. I'm thinking of middle aged men in my life and how I've seen them react to tragedy, and what would might be attractive to them while they're in this dark place of suffering. It's kinda hard.

But, he's a really important part of the script, and writing better male characters is on my list of things I need to get better at. So I will try (probably fail) and try again, until I can get it right (or as close to right as possible). I think it's important to push the things that we aren't comfortable with, because *doing* them is our only chance to get better at them. Plus, it's more satisfying to watch Rosie destroy a real person, instead of a card board cut out.

If you have any thoughts on middle aged men, and what you think would/could make them though out logic for a woman, send them my way! Here's my email : [Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com)

And yes, I did think of sex, but isn't there something more? Or is it different sex? I will think on it a ton, and if anything comes to mind on your end, let me know!
