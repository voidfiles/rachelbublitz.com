title: THIS LINGERING LIFE by Chiori Miyagawa
---

[Playwrights' Foundation](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=1) is hosting a reading of [Chiori Miyagawa](http://chiorimiyagawa.com/)'s [*This Lingering Life*](http://playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=53#ThisLingeringLife) as a part of their Rough Reading series. Guess who's helping out? Me! The readings will take place this coming Monday and Tuesday evening (the 14th and 15th).

Monday, the reading begins at 7:30 and takes place at [Roble Hall](http://campus-map.stanford.edu/?id=&lat=37.42861826913899&lng=-122.17458799999999&zoom=15&srch=Roble%20Hall%20Complex) in Stanford.

Tuesday, the reading begins at 7 and takes place in San Francisco at [NOHSpace](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=2840+Mariposa+Street,+San+Francisco,+CA+94110&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x808f7e30658d6e49:0x7862efa9e6697239,2840+Mariposa+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94110&gl=us&ei=qJPsUID0BseciAKp34D4BQ&ved=0CDMQ8gEwAA) in Potrero. 

These readings are co-hosted by the [Theatre of Yugen](http://www.theatreofyugen.org/), and I am really excited to hear this new play. Hope you can come by and see some fresh theatre!
