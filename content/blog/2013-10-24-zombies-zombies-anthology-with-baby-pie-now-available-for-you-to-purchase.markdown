title: Zombies?! Zombies!! Anthology with BABY PIE now available for you to purchase
---

My short play *Baby Pie* is in anthology called [Zombies?! Zombies!!](http://bookstore.iuniverse.com/Products/SKU-000608394/Zombies--Zombies.aspx) and you can now buy your own copy! How exciting is that?

I wrote *Baby Pie* over a year and a half ago, it's based on a nightmare. And it's one of the strangest things I've ever written. So don't delay, put your order in now and get your copy for Halloween!

Here's the link:
