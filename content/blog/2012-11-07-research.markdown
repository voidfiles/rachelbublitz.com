It is official... I am beginning a new full length play. Oh, I am so excited. I am in the middle of reading the first of three books that will be the bulk of my research for the play. Research! I know... This will be my first time writing a play that I'll need to do research to write! Now I am realizing how much of a nerd I actually am... I am excited by research. Oh well, there are worse things.
