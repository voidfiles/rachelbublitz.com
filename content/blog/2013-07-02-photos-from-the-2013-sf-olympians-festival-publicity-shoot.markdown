title: Photos From The 2013 SF Olympians' Festival Publicity Shoot
---

This past weekend I threw on one of my kid's sheets and took pictures with a handful of my fellow writers from the [San Francisco Olympians' Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) at Alamo Square in San Francisco. [Claire Rice](http://claireannrice.blogspot.com/) was our brilliant photographer, and here are a couple of pictures! If you want to see more, check out the [San Francisco Olympians' Festival facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/San-Francisco-Olympians-Festival/282661841972?fref=ts) for the rest!
