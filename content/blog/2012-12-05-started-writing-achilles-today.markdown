I *love* starting a new play. It's all rosy cheeks and endless opportunities. It's actually quite similar to having a new born, when you look at them, or think about them, you think of all the glorious/amazing/beautiful/inspiring things they have to offer the world. They're fresh and new, and not tainted by anything. And a new play, or any new project is much the same. So I'm in the romantic/honeymoon stage of my play, and I'm trying to milk it for all it's worth. I've banged out the first five scenes, and I'm hoping to finish the sixth one tonight. It's a little hard considering I'm also in the middle of moving and packing and all those pesky holidays, but to hell with everything else! I've got a first draft to get out!
