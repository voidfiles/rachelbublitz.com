title: 'PlayGround Topic Announced: THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH'
---

The topic has been announced! The first Monday Night [PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/) will have the theme: THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH. The whole evening (Monday October 21st) is dedicated to the late Barbara Oliver, who founded the [Aurora Theater Company](https://www.auroratheatre.org/?gclid=CK7XhZC1j7oCFQnhQgodQxsACQ) and was a long time member/board member of PlayGround. One of her favorite playwrights happened to be [Thorton Wilder](http://www.thorntonwilder.com/), and that's where the topic came from (*The Skin Of Our Teeth* is a three-act play by Thorton Wilder).

If you want to play (or write!) along at home you have until Tuesday at 2pm to get your scripts done, and there is a ten page max. 

Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some more reading/researching/thinking/writing to get to!
