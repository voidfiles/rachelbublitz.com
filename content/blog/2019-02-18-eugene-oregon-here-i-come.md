My bags are (kinda/almost) packed, I'm leaving tonight for Eugene, Oregon and the [Region 7 Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival Conference](http://kcactf7.org/)! It's going to be a packed week of theater including watching invited productions and new play readings, judging/responding to the student written one-act and ten-minute plays, teaching TWO workshops, and seeing both the reading of [*RED DAYS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232234/red-days) (Wednesday night, 2/20 at 8pm, at the [Oregon Contemporary Theatre](https://www.octheatre.org/)!) and the design through dramaturgy projects inspired by the play. And that's just what's on the books! There will also be plenty of walking in the rain, meeting new theater friends, and catching up with creators I've known for years. It's gonna be soooooo goooooood! I'm hoping I can also make time for sleeping, but I'll have to play that by ear.

Check back at the end of the week so you can hear all about it!

Happy Monday!
