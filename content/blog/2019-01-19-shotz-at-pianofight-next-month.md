Exciting/last minute news, I wrote a brand new short play this past week and it'll be performed next month, February 6th, for [Shotz](https://www.facebook.com/events/1869335626525893/) at [PianoFight](https://www.pianofight.com/)! The theme this month is "Hell Hath No Fury," which I found out is *not* a Shakespeare quote at all, though it's often attributed to Shakespeare. It is actually a quote from the play *THE MOURNING BRIDE* by William Congreve. The entire quote, which I'm crazy about, goes:

>"Heav'n has no rage like love to hatred turn'd / Nor Hell a fury, like a woman scorn'd."

 The play I wrote, *FOR THE LOVE OF LITTLE LYDIA*, will be directed by Giselle Boustani, with the acting talents of Janice Rumschlag and Sara-Jean Bartkey.

 So that's the scoop. Be sure to check out the show at PianoFight, at 7pm on Wednesday, February 6th!

 Happy weekend everyone!
