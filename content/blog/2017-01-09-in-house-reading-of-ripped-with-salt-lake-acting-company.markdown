title: In-House Reading of RIPPED With Salt Lake Acting Company!
---

Very excited to announce the next thing for RIPPED, [Salt Lake Acting Company](http://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/) is hosting an in-house reading of the play with their starving artist program. We'll be reading the play with all college students, and mostly college students in the room. I can't wait to see what their take on the play is, especially compared to the surprising reaction I got from the [San Francisco Playhouse reading](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2016/10/25/last-nights-ripped-reading/) this past October.
