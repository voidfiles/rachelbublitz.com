title: MUCH ADO ABOUT MATHLETES Opens Tonight
---

Tonight! 7pm! At the Little Theater at SFSU! *Much Ado About Mathletes*, my 30-minute one-act is going up! I like exclamation marks!!!!

Please join me for the fun, my play will close an evening of four one-act plays. Here's a bit about the play, in case you have forgotten:

>"An all-girls mathletes team (that ponders in iambic pentameter) is shaken to it's core when it's asked to do the unthinkable... Let a boy join their team."

With Shannon Sullivan, Jackie Orozco, Gina Terrell, Bella Connick, Ghena Euodia, Joceyln McMahon, Geoffrey Malveaux, and Andrew Morris.

Directed by Kathleen Lee!
