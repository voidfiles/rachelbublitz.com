title: Taking 2014 By Storm
---

I have had SUCH a productive playwriting week this week! It is exactly what I needed after slacking off for two weeks. Oh, it feels so good. SO GOOD!

I have a first draft of my not-yet-titled play about Pegasus, that I am completely in love with. I have rewrites for my horror play *Rosie, Bloody Rosie*, through it's workshop with [Fresh Produce'd LA](http://www.importedtalent.com/Styled-3/page5.html) PS, you should TOTALLY come for the reading on Thursday, April 17th! 7:30 pm, the first 1/3 of the play will be read! Find out all the details here: [http://www.facebook.com/events/255247261314080/](http://www.facebook.com/events/255247261314080/)!

So far this year I've written (from scratch!) one full-length play, a 50(ish) minute one-act, and 4 ten minute plays. I've also done serious rewrites on my 60 minutes horror play, *Rosie, Bloody Rosie*, and to date I've submitted 113 times.

2014 is my most productive year as a playwright so far, and I hope to raise the bar even higher as the year keeps on moving! 

So be sure to check on back. Big things are happening over here. BIG things.
