title: Catch "The Garden" Tonight With PlayGround's Alumni Night
---

I am so proud to have a play in [Monday Night PlayGround](http://blog.playground-sf.org/2015/09/playgrounds-alumni-night-selections.html) tonight! It's special for a few reasons, it's Alumni Night, which means any writer who has had a play in Best of PlayGround was invited to submit, it's also the 22nd Season Opener, AND the topic is "Race Matters." 

I'll be quite honest, I was scared almost to death of taking on this topic, but I didn't want to miss an opportunity to challenge myself and to comment and think deeply about something I find myself contemplating often anyway. I am honored that my play, *The Garden*, was selected and even MORE honored because the other artists working on the piece with me are amazing; Margo Hall is directing, and in the play is Tristan Cunningham and Gwen Loeb. I nearly cried when I saw this team. 

The full line-up includes:

*Puncturing the Dream* by William Bivins, directed by Steven Anthony Jones

*The Garden* by Rachel Bublitz, directed by Margo Hall

*White Guilt Anonymous* by Ruben Grijalva, directed by Cindy Goldfield

*Lesson One* by Genevieve Jessee, directed by Jim Kleinmann

*Archive* by Kenneth Prestininzi, directed by Jon Tracy

*Sunday Mourning* by Mercedes Segesvary, directed by Tamiyka White

And the actors for this evening are:

Michael Asberry, Michael Barrett Austin, Aldo Billingslea, Tristan Cunningham, Jackson Davis, Dodds Delzell, Britney Frazier, Norman Gee, Douglas Giorgis, Christian Haines, Daryl Anthony Harper, Patrick Kelly Jones, Lisa Lacy, Gwen Loeb, Kelvyn Mitchell, David Moore, Lisa Morse, John Nahigian, Melissa Ortiz, Cathleen Riddley, Adam Roy, Alex Shafer, Teddy Spencer, and Anthony Williams!

I hope you can make the time to come out for the show, it's at Berkeley Rep at 8pm, for tickets and more info: [http://playground-sf.org/boxoffice/](http://playground-sf.org/boxoffice/)

See you tonight!
