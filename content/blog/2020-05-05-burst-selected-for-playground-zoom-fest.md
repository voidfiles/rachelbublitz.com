My full-length science play [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) has been selected for [PlayGround](https://playground-sf.org/)'s 2020 [ZOOM FEST](https://playground-sf.org/the-playground-festival-goes-digital/), which will kick off later this month on May 11th! It's of course sad to not be able to head out to the Bay Area, and work in a room with these brilliant artists, but I am SO pleased that PlayGround found a way to make this year's festival work within the stay-at-home limitations. How does a Zoom Festival work, you ask? Well, we will be finding that out together!

Soon we'll be announcing the director and cast. But for now, save Monday, June 1st on your calendars, and read more about the [ZOOM FEST here](https://playground-sf.org/the-playground-festival-goes-digital/)! It includes the entire amazing line-up and information on how to tune in. Can't wait to hear the latest draft worked out over the internet.

And I have more fun news about *BURST* coming soon too, so be sure to check back!

As always, I hope you are well in mind, body, and spirit! Happy Tuesday!
