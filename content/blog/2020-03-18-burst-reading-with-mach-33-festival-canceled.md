The reading of [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) which was set to be a part of the 2020 MACH 33 festival of new science driven plays with CalTech and Pasadena Playhouse has been canceled. Not a shock, as lots and lots of things are getting canceled now. And I imagine I'll have more news of more canceled events over the next few months as the pandemic stretched on.

The good news is the good people involved with MACH 33 still want to develop *BURST* and support the play through science dramaturgy over the internet. And they're also hoping this is a postponement and not a cancelation. Time will tell! I will be sure to announce any updates on this front here, so be sure to check back.

In other news starting tomorrow I will be posting pieces of my favorite workshop I teach, Relentless Playwriting, on the blog as a series! I will weekly, as long as my kids are set up enough with their home school day and they don't have a million questions I don't have the answers to. We shall see!

For now, best of luck staying both well and sane.
