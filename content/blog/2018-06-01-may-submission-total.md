It's the first day of a new month, which means........................ Time to check in on my #submissionmission!!!! 

I had a lot of writing and rewriting in May (as well as a show opening!), so my submissions were put on the back burner. I sent things out when something easy popped up right in front of me, but I couldn't fit in any days dedicated to *only* submitting, which I'll usually try to squeeze in at least once a week. All that to say that I was astonished to see my actual numbers for last month... Maybe I'm becoming a submission robot or something, because even without trying I sent out FIFTY TWO submissions last month! 

(Insert celebratory music, in my mind it's a mariachi band, but it's super flexible, so you do you.)

Yay! With 52 submissions for the month of May, my 2018 #submissionmission total is up to 275! And with seven months still left in the year I'm feeling pretty good at my goal and where I'm at, though... This will be the first summer in many many summers where both of my kids will NOT be going to summer camp regularly, so we'll see how confident I'm feeling come August.... BUT, what if I train them to submit plays for me? I could  get a whole factory line thing going on... Oh, the possibilities... 

Happy June and almost summer everyone!
