title: Buy Your Tickets For PCSF's 24 Hour Playfest!
---

We're less than a week and a half away from the 24 Hour Playfest! This is PCSF's big fundraiser, if you didn't know, [Playwright's Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/index.htm) helps and supports playwrights in the bay area. I found them close to a year ago, and I can say they've helped me learn a lot! I've had a staged reading, and coming up on a developmental reading with PCSF, and I regularly attend their bi-monthly scene nights. I've also met a lot of other playwrights and theatre folks through PCSF. 

Please help support this organization and buy your tickets today! You can [BUY TICKETS HERE](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/267511). The house is small, and it would be great if we sold out both shows! So tell your friends, your family, even your co-workers. Get the word out. This is going to be a wonderful night of theatre, and you won't want to miss it. In a lot of ways seeing the show will help you (because it's going to be *that* good, and good theatre makes everything better) and PCSF and all the playwrights that they help. It's a win, win, win situation. So, go ahead and [BUY TICKETS HERE](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/267511), don't be shy!
