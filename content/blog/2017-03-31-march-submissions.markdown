title: March Submissions! #submissionmission
---

March is SO over. Well, very soon it will be. And this past month I have been *busy* with submissions. Busy, busy, busy. I have submitted 64 plays this month. Yep. SIXTY FOUR. That is MORE than two a day. I had to make up for my dismal February performance, I guess. 

Anyway, adding this month to January and February brings my total to 119 for the year so far. If I keep this up, I may just break my own record for plays submitted in a calendar year, [which was 366 submissions back in 2014](http://rachelbublitz.alexkessinger.net/blog/2015/01/05/2014-submission-mission/). Can I do it? 

Guess you'll have to hang out to find out....
