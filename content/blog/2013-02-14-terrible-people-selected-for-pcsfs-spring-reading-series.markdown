title: TERRIBLE PEOPLE selected for PCSF's Spring Reading Series
---

*Terrible People* has been selected for [Playwrights' Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/)'s [Spring Reading Series](http://playwrightscentersf.org/#spring2013). Yay! I'm especially excited to crack it open again and tinker with it. This was the exciting news that I got yesterday, if you're wondering. So if you're into ladies that kill people, be sure to check it out! Not sure when it'll be, could be in May, June, or July... I'll be sure to post about it, so don't worry. 

I also got an awesome email this morning that I'm still glowing over. It's a fine day to be a playwright.

Happy Valentine's Day folks!
