title: Gearing Up For March 3rd Reading Of UNDER THE GODS GOLDEN CLEATS
---

Holy cow! In one week my epic full-length play that mashes together the Trojan War with Texas high school football will come back to the stage! Tomorrow night we have rehearsal, and today I'll be busy reading through the newest draft, printing that draft, and then picking up snacks for all the awesome artists working so hard to bring this reading to life. Then I get to finish my homework (yay!). Luckily I have some backup today, my wonderful mother-in-law is visiting and so my large and scary work-load is actually obtainable! Hooray for Katy!

Well, got to jump back into it so I can get it all done!

Weeeeeeeee!
