title: The Clerical Error
---

Remember when I said I was rejected by SFSU's MFA program? Funny thing about that, turns out I was accepted! I was notified earlier today, a clerical error had been made and it wasn't caught until now. Crazy, right? Turns out I'll have less time this coming fall than I thought.
