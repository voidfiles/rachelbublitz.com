I really *LOVE* being able to share such exciting news!

I will be teaching an online class with the one and only [Lauren Gunderson](https://www.facebook.com/LaurenGundersonPlaywright/), the most produced living playwright in the USA! We will be analyzing my award willing play *RIPPED*, and talking craft and career.

Catch us LIVE on Facebook June 5th at 11am (PST)! F[or more details, or to RSVP, check out this event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/678543379607870/).

In the mean time, you can download and read the script on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped?fbclid=IwAR0mEQTibt6-vZ4sYSVvjUUymKtzO3n8s9StzspfQLys_brOo89fKVgRgbw). And then head over to [Lauren's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/LaurenGundersonPlaywright/) and watch through the amazing classes Lauren has taught, all are free and open to the public! She has already had on some phenomenal guest theater artists.

Happy Tuesday!
