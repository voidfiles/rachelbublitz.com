Last week I received some pretty AMAZING news that I've had to sit on, but finally the time to share has come.... *RIPPED* is going up in Australia!!! [The Owl and Cat Theatre](https://www.owlandcat.com.au/) in Melbourne, Australia is putting up a short run of *RIPPED* to kick off their 2017/18 season! The artistic director for The Owl and Cat Theatre, Thomas Ian Doyle, will direct the show, and we've been emailing back and forth figuring out how I can be involved from so far away. I'm thankful I got to spend nearly a week in Melbourne earlier this year, but how I wish the trip had somehow overlapped with rehearsals... Thank goodness for Skype!

*RIPPED* will open October 18th and run for three weeks. I'll have casting updates and production photos soon, so be sure to stay tuned!
