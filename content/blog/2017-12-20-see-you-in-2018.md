I’m leaving on a jet airplane in just a few hours to celebrate the holidays in California. And as a Christmas present to myself, I’m leaving my computer at home! So if you need me, you’re going to have to wait until next year. 

I hope everyone has a safe and relaxing last two weeks of December! I’ll be announcing my 2018 goals and my submission total for 2017, so be sure to check back in early January. Happy end of 2017 one and all!
