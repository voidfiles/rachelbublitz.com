title: Knee Deep in Submissions
---

The fun never ends! Right now I'm working on submissions around the clock; submissions that I'm reading for the [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com)'s anthology and staged reading and submissions of my own work. 

We have 96 plays to consider, and I plan on reading them all. I've nearly made it through the F's (I'm going in alphabetical order from last name). And while I'm not going to tell you how I feel about the writing at all, I will say that it's a lot of fun thinking about how this little silly project of mine and Tracy's has transformed into what it is today. I'm incredibly excited about both the internet reading and the anthology. Once we announce the plays on December 1st we're going to set to work on both... Telling everyone right now, we'll be needing actors and directors. So if you know me and your'e one of those two things don't be surprised when you get an email from me asking you to participate!

And yes, quite a few submission deadlines are looming ahead of me and so I'm trying to get to those as well. I won't be submitting 30 plays this month, but I'm still getting my work out there. These are the things I'm trying to get things ready for:

1. [Berkeley Rep's Ground Floor](http://www.berkeleyrep.org/about/groundfloor.asp), deadline 11/1.

1. [Dayton Playhouse](http://www.daytonplayhouse.org/), deadline 10/31. Also snail mail only.

1. [Dragon Productions Theatre Co.](http://dragonproductions.net/activities/2013season/npdfsubmissioncriteria.html), deadline is 11/1. There is a $10 fee with this submission.

1. [Bay Area Playwright's Festival from Playwrights Foundation](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/), the deadline is 10/31. And there is a $20 fee.

1. [Sundance Theatre Lab](http://www.sundance.org/programs/theatre-lab-guidelines/), which has a 11/15 deadline and a steep $35 fee.

What are you submitting to right now?
