File this under EXCITING and LAST MINUTE NEWS.... [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) my new new new play will get its very first reading in front of an audience this coming Saturday, August 3rd at 11pm following the shows at the [Utah Shakespeare Festival](https://www.bard.org/) in Cedar City, Utah! The reading is being produced by [REACH](https://www.facebook.com/REACH-Cabaret-2018-177085979625728/), which stands for *Really Eager Actors Crying Hire*, and is a part of a reading series that's a fundraiser for their annual cabaret event.

While I'm down at the Utah Shakespeare Festival I'm catching [*THE MERCHANT OF VENICE*](https://www.bard.org/plays/2018/the-merchant-of-venice) and *[THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR*](https://www.bard.org/plays/2018/the-merry-wives-of-windsor)! I'm SO PUMPED to check out how my play is doing AND get to know this amazing (and close by) festival that I've been hearing great things about for years. 

Happy Monday everyone!
