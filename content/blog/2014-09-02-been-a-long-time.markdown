Summer is gone! When did that happen? Oy vey.

Mine was intense, busy, and productive. I wrote my first screenplay, and put in some major time getting two other large projects further in their development. One could say that I took on too much this summer, and I don't think they'd be wrong.

This was my first year that I didn't participate in the [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/) challenge. This year I only cheered people on from the sidelines. 

I've also fallen behind in my own personal goal to submit 365 scripts, as of today I've submitted on 211. But, I think if I push through it I can catch up within a month or so.

Another exciting adventure I've started is the mess of paperwork one needs in order to write a thesis! Exciting, huh? I'm getting two master's degrees in my time at SFSU, starting my first thesis this Spring, and I'm very glad that I started my inquiries early - lots of hoops to jump through.

What did you do this summer?
