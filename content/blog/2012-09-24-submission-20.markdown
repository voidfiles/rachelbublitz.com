title: Submission 20
---

I just submitted OY OY OY, MERRY CHRISTMAS! to [Unity Stage Company](http://nycp.blogspot.com/2012/09/unity-stage-company-is-seeking-short.html). They're looking for unsentimental, comedic, plays about Christmas ranging from 1-12 minutes. The deadline is the 29th of October. 

Only ten more to go, and less than I week to go! Will I survive the binge and meet the challenge of submitting 30 plays in the month of September? Stay tuned to find out!
