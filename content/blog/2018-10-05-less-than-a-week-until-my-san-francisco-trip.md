I will be in San Francisco in less than one week from today!!

I have a packed schedule as usual, filled with shows, rehearsals, meetings with theater folks, getting my hair cut, and the consuming of many many many delicious meals, snacks, and desserts... 

And there are SO MANY GREAT SHOW OPTIONS, you guys! Bay Area is really pulling out all the stops this time. Here's my wish list, we'll see how many of the shows I can squeeze into my four days:

### [Problematic Play Festival](http://www.zspace.org/problematic) at [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/) - of course!

The whole reason for my trip, participating in Z Space's very first problematic play festival... WHICH I AM EXTREMELY EXCITED FOR! If you're free Saturday night (the 13th!), be sure to come on down for the reading of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) at 8pm! Here's the whole schedule for the festival:

Friday, October 12 at 8pm: [*Phosphorescence* by Cory Hinkle](http://www.zspace.org/phosphorescence/), directed by Michael French

### [*SWEAT* by Lynn Nottage at ACT](http://www.act-sf.org/home/box_office/1819_season/sweat.html)

I've been dying to see *SWEAT* since it opened on Broadway, and I'm SO glad my trip out to SF worked out so that I can catch ACT's production. Yay! More about *SWEAT*:

>"In Reading, Pennsylvania—the blue-collar heart of America’s steel industry—a tight-knit group of factory workers has gathered in the local bar for generations to share laughs, hopes, and cold beers. But as the country heads into a new millennium, recession looms, and a lock-out turns assembly line into picket line, one event will send shockwaves through these lifelong friends, pitting them against each other in the struggle to survive."

>"Inspired by the stories of Rust Belt workers, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage (Ruined) unites heart and humor and “goes where few playwrights have dared to go” (Variety) to forge a searing drama of the grit, drive, and resilience of our conflicted American dreams."

*SWEAT* is running now through October 21st!

### [Awesome Theatre's TERROR-RAMA](https://awesometheatre.org/shows-projects/terror-rama/)

My trip also lined up so that I can catch Awesome Theatre's TERROR-RAMA, because apparently fate was on my side for this one. This year's line-up is:

TERROR-RAMA III:DEAD THE WHOLE TIME  
Directed by Christian Haines  
Hosted by Sindie Choppe

*The Suffered* By [Colin Johnson](https://twitter.com/cojohnz)

>"Frederick, a once popular author, now seeing his fame fade retreats to a small hotel for the memorial of his recently deceased wife, Lillian. But when a strange song awakens the truth of Lillian’s death, Frederick cannot escape his secrets."

and

*My Cannibal Summer* By [Claire Rice](https://twitter.com/claireannrice)

>"A gated community of cannibals welcomes home one of their own from war. But something is different, Eddie doesn’t have “The Hunger” anymore. When he falls for the community’s newest resident Sonia, he decides to escape and finds out coming home is easy, but leaving could kill you."

Claire Rice just happens to be one of my all-time favorite people, and Awesome Theatre is consistently putting out really fun shows. TERROR-RAMA runs at PianoFight October 12, 13, 19, 20, 26, and 27 at 7PM.

There are so many shows I want to see too, the Bay Area makes it tough on me, but I am up for the challenge. SIX MORE DAYS until I can bask in your glorious foggy weather and eat all of that yummy food! Will I see you at any of these shows? What are your theater plans next week!

Happy Friday!
