title: Cat Ladies Recap
---

Women in Solodarity, Cat Ladies is over! Yes I know it closed last Saturday and here it is *Wednesday* already, but I've been one busy momma. Anyway, it was a fantastic show (that just might come back!) and I was honored to be a part of it. Here are some pictures from closing night, enjoy! 

Once again all of the shots are from [Rob Reeves](http://suckypictures.blogspot.com/?zx=da79e9239054d5d).
