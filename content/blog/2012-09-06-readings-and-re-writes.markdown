title: Readings and Re-Writes
---

Last night I had five talented ladies in my house, and we had a reading night. It was great. I got to hear all of TERRIBLE PEOPLE out loud, and spent all morning working on it. The [BOA](http://bayoneacts.org/submissions/) is coming up (September 15th to be exact) and I'm working hard to get my play in tip-top shape. I found it interesting that the opening scene of my play was kinda flat (it has always been super funny) and the closing scene, the scene I've worked with the least really worked well. Pretty sure I'll be bringing in the opening scene to scene night at PCSF tonight. 

In other news, I have an interview (gasp!) for a paying job (double gasp!) tomorrow morning. So, be sure and send all of those eloquent and articulate vibes my way.
