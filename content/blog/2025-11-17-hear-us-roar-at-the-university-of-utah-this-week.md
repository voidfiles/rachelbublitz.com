I am *thrilled* to invite you out this week to catch a performance of my new play *Hear Us Roar* at the University of Utah! *Hear Us Roar* is about a collegiate water polo team in the late 90's, and also happens to be my first attempt at a sports play. Why, oh why, would I pick water polo for the stage? I like a challenge, but also I know the sport pretty well through the endless tournaments my kids play at, and my husband coaches at. Water polo is tough, and rough, and for those of us who don't play, seems utterly impossible at times. The play is set at a time the sport received a small explosion in popularity, and I think water polo is long over do for another.

The performances are a culmination of a months long workshop, where director Alexandra Harbold, movement director Call Vande Veegaete, water polo dramaturg Audrey Kessinger, our fabulous and fearless cast, and myself tried to figure out how we could evoke the feeling of water polo play on stage without water or a ball or an elaborate lifting systems. Have we gotten it? You can be the judge!

And where are these amazing rehearsal process photographs coming from? A brilliant friend of mine, Ashlee Macdonald, is a documentary photographer and asked if she could document our workshop. Of course I said YES! I'll be posting more after the performances this week, or check out more right now on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/playwrightbublitz/).
