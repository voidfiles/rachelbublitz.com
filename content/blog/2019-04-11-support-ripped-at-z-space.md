The world premiere of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) at [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/) is around the corner! Previews kick off May 22nd, and opening night is May 25th! While you still have over a month of waiting ahead of you, I am here to offer you a way to get involved with the production right now!...

Z Space is currently accepting donations to support this world premiere, if you love bold and risky theater, I hope you'll consider throwing what you can our way! What would the money go toward? Glad you asked...

>Just a few reasons to support Z Space’s world premiere of *RIPPED* by Rachel Bublitz  

>* *RIPPED* is in line with Z Space’s mission of supporting powerful and risky new work. Ripped has been a part of seven workshops and readings, but Z Space will be the first theater to bring this play to full production.

>* The cost of producing this work responsibly means that we will put funds toward hiring an intimacy director as well as talk-back facilitators. We are also flying the playwright out from Salt Lake City to ensure her involvement in the rehearsal process.

 >* Executive Artistic Director Lisa Steindler has a long history of supporting artists, but this will be the first time Lisa will direct a show for Z Space. This is your opportunity to support Lisa in her Z Space directorial debut with this challenging production. This is your chance to give back to Lisa as an artist!
