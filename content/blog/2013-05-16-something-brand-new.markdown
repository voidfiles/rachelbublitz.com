title: Something Brand New
---

There is a serious romance that happens whenever I think of a new play I want to write... The honeymoon stage. Next semester (my *first* semester at SFSU) I'll be taking a class called, directed writing. Basically, a teacher reads a play I'm developing and acts as a dramaturge. I was very excited to sign up for this class, and when I thought about which play I wanted to work on I decided to write something brand new for it. I was advised to write a new full length play for each semester I have at grad school, so this will be my first of (hopefully) six. I figure if I have a first draft before August (and I will be writing 31 short plays) I'll be all set to work on this play all semester.

Now to the fun part... The romantic part... I love my idea. I don't want to give away too much... But right now it's looking to be an all female cast... Sci-fi... And there will be a giant squid in the opening scene. Yes. A giant squid. What's *not* to love? This is the fun part... The part that I go to sleep at night and think up all the exciting scenes I want to include... The characters I get to create. I know there will come a time when I want to shove the whole script into a pot and set it aflame... But for know I'm in love.
