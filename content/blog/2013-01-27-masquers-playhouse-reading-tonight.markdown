title: Masquers Playhouse Reading TONIGHT
---

Yesterday we had a fabulous rehearsal (photos on the way) and tonight is going to be incredibly funny. I know that the theatre isn't the easiest places to get to, but you will not be disappointed if you come!

Make a night out of it, there are plenty of cute restaurants in the area!
