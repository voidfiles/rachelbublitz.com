*Thrilled* to announce the World Premiere of [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) at [Mile Square Theatre](https://www.milesquaretheatre.org/) in Hoboken, New Jersey in their 2023/24 season!!! That by itself is obviously amazing, but it gets better.... *Funny, Like An Abortion* will *also* go on to premiere at [*Cleveland Public Theatre*](https://www.cptonline.org/) in their 2023/24 season!

Mile Square Theatre's production will run October 18 - November 12, 2023! So mark your calendars if you're close, or interested in a road trip!

Cleveland Public Theatre's production will run April 25 - May 11, 2024, and will be directed by [Paige Conway](https://www.paigeconway.com/). So if you're closer to Cleveland, mark these dates!

I am *SO FREAKING PUMPED* for both of these productions. Check here for more information on both as more information is available.

Happy Monday!
