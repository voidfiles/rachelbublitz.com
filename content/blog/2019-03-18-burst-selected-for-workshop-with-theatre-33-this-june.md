Call me busy this summer, after I open [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) at [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/) March 24th I'll be headed up to Salem, Oregon for a workshop of [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) with [Theatre 33](http://www.theatre33.org/)! Theatre 33, is residence at Willamette University, is a new play development company using resources to workshop new plays, with dramaturgs and directors, culminating in script-in-hand performances that'll include light, sound, costumes, and talk-backs.

Deb Vaughn will work as dramaturg, and my director is Theresa Robbins Dudeck. I'll be heading out to Salem for the readings which will run June 12th - June 16th. Yes, that's right, *BURST* will get a total of SIX readings over five days! I am so thrilled to be headed back to Oregon, to work with Theatre 33, and to get the time to really dig into *BURST*. If you are in or near Oregon, I hope you will make it out to catch one of the performances! Here's the full line-up for Theatre 33's summer reading series:
