Last night's reading of [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) was amazing! Thank you [Salt Lake Acting Company](https://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/)!!! My actors, Adriana Lemke, Ava Kostia, and Lily Hye Soo Dixon were incredible. They were making new discoveries and finding depth in their character right through rehearsals and into the reading. The final major monologue delivered by Ava Kostia left her almost in tears, and completely took my breath away. I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS PLAY!

Thank you fantastic actors! And thank you Erika Ovuoba, reading stage directions. Thank you [Shannon Musgrave](https://saltlakeactingcompany.org/about/administrative-and-production-staff/item/1024-shannon-musgrave) for directing the play, and for asking such great questions throughout the process. This workshop had such an impact on the script! I'm really proud of where the script is at right now, and I'm about to jump in for some delicious rewrites that I can't wait to share with all of you soon!

I also want to thank [Cynthia Fleming](https://saltlakeactingcompany.org/about/administrative-and-production-staff/item/1022-cynthia-fleming), the artistic director of [Salt Lake Acting Company](https://saltlakeactingcompany.org/). I am so grateful for the chance to develop my work on your stage, and would jump to work at your theater again. You have surrounded yourself with such great people, and it's exciting to see the work you put out there for Utah audiences.

Finally, thank you to my audience! We had a packed house! It's thrilling to see such devotion to new work here in Salt Lake. You sure know how to make a girl feel welcome.

Happy Tuesday!
