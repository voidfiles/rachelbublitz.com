Nearly forgot to post about all the wonderful plays I recommended last month on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard)! Whoops! Here are all the great new plays I read and recommended:

* [*DOMINION: Prelude to an Activist* by Brigitte Viellieu-Davis](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/336797/dominion-prelude-activist)  
* [*Once I Was a Kingdom* by Gemma Cooper-Novack](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/167333/once-i-was-kingdom)  
* [*Pay It Backward* by Donna Hoke](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/150685/pay-it-backward)  
* [*Poetic License* by Diane Sampson](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/221608/poetic-license)  
* [*Ava Maria* by Anne Flanagan](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/336969/ava-maria)  
* [*Swimming with Giants* by Liz Kerlin](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/336908/swimming-giants)  
* [*HYPE MAN: a break beat play* by Idris Goodwin](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/65655/hype-man-break-beat-play)  
* [*Blackademics* by Idris Goodwin](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/350/blackademics)  
* [*For The Love Of (or, the Roller Derby Play)* by Gina Femia](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/31839/love-or-roller-derby-play)  

If you're interested in new plays, and you're not on New Play Exchange, I would highly recommend you join up.... For a low yearly fee you will have an immense amount of brand new work at your fingertips. It's worth every cent!

Anyway... Read these plays, recommend these plays, and *PRODUCE* these plays!

What great new play have you read lately?
