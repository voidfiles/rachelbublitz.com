---

Woo!

My ten minute play *Baby Shower Games* is getting it's THIRD production!  May 30, 31, and June 1st with [Love Creek Productions](http://facebook.com/pages/Love-Creek-Productions/58978756369) at [The Producer's Club](http://google.com/maps/preview?q=358+W+44th+New+York,+NY+10036&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x89c25853b1eabb65:0xdc09cbe3f1dcfbdb,358+W+44th+St,+New+York,+NY+10036&gl=us&ei=vGthU_bMHoamyAS124DYDw&ved=0CCgQ8gEwAA) in New York City!

*Baby Shower Games* was originally produced in September of 2013 for [All Terrain Theater](http://allterraintheater.org/)'s [SF Fringe](http://www.sffringe.org/) showcase: [Babies, The Ultimate Birth Control](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2013/09/09/babies-the-ultimate-birth-control-is-hilarious/) (which won Best of Fringe!). This past January *Baby Shower Games* was produced a second time with [Acme Theater Productions](http://www.acmetheater.com/index.asp) in Maynard, Maine. *Baby Shower Games* was also a semi-finalist in the [Lakeshore Players](http://www.lakeshoreplayers.com/)' 10th Annual 10-Minute Play Festival.

And now it moves on to New York! I am very excited, and I hope that if you're in New York City, you check out the show!
