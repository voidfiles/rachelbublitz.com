title: PlayGround's Holiday Extravaganza TONIGHT at 8pm!
---

TONIGHT! 

TONIGHT is the night!

Tonight my ten minute play *Mom's Ham* will be performed at [Berkeley Rep](http://www.berkeleyrep.org/) for [PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/)'s [(Twisted) HOLIDAY EXTRAVAGANZA](https://www.facebook.com/events/520778374687311/?ref=br_tf)!

I love my play and I'm very excited that it was picked and I get to share it with everyone! Which means you should come on out to Berkeley tonight for the 8p show! Can you make it out? I sure hope you can! There will be a pre-show talk starting at 7:10pm also, so show up early and here more about the work from the writers! 

See you tonight!
