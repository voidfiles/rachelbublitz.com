title: UNDER THE GODS' GOLDEN CLEATS Reading Tonight 7pm at Tides Theatre
---

Tonight! Tonight is the night! *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* will be read at Tides Theatre tonight at 7pm. If you can get there closer to 6:45, that would be great because we'll be starting right at 7pm.

I have wine! Chips! Salsa! Cookies! And chocolate covered cherries! So not only will you get to hear the newest draft of my epic football meets the Trojan War play, but you'll get to drink and snack with us too? That's fun, right?

Best part, is that it is totally FREE! And I have a killer cast. And a killer director. And the script is pretty great too. So, nothing to lose!

SEE YOU TONIGHT!
