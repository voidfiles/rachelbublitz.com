Summer is almost at its end, and I have just one more play for your reading list: [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/browse/the-night-witches), available with [Dramatic Publishing](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/).

*The Night Witches* is my most produced play, with more than fifty productions worldwide. I made a short video for this one, with some production shots and posters from various productions. I am exceedingly proud of this play, especially because every six months or so I get an email from an actor bursting with how much joy this play brought to them. I often write to create the roles I wish existed when I was in high school and college, and *The Night Witches* is packed full of roles I would have be absolutely thrilled to embody.

Here's the synopsis for *The Night Witches*:

>*The Night Witches of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment flew in planes made of canvas and wood, and they dropped bombs on Germans every 15 minutes through the night to keep their enemy from sleeping. They were constantly being shuffled and moved to perform new duties; mechanics became navigators, navigators became pilots, and pilots became commanders. Nina and Vera have just finished their training as navigators and are moments away from their first combat mission. As they fight their nerves, the women around them use different means of bolstering their spirits, some more successfully than others. But when the time comes, to the sky they must go. Tonight, however, is different than any night they’ve faced before—their enemy has employed a new tactic taking them completely by surprise. Using movement, song and lyrically styled dialogue, we follow these brave women through one fateful evening during the war.*

*The Night Witches* is available both as [full-length](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/browse/the-night-witches) and [one-act](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/browse/the-night-witches-competition) play, with casts of either 11 to 18 women (full-length) or 9 to 16 (one-act).

Happy almost end of summer!
