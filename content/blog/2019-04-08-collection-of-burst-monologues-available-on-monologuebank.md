Have you heard of [MonologueBank](https://www.monologuebank.com/)? It's a website for actors looking for new audition material, and has tons of awesome brand new plays available. In the mix are *four* plays from my full-length [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst)! And and and, if any of you out there are itching to give MonologueBank a try, I have a deal for you! You can save on any of my material using the code: [BUBLITZ50](https://www.monologuebank.com/rachel-bublitz.html). The code is case sensitive, so be sure you capitalize all the letters. And happy spending! The first fifty transactions will receive 50% off with that code, and each person may use it twice.

So go download! The collection from *BURST* has some fierce and fiery characters for women to jump into.

And there's more coming soon! Check back soon, because this is just the beginning. Very soon there'll be a lot more of [my work up on MonologueBank](https://www.monologuebank.com/rachel-bublitz.html) for your audition and education needs.
