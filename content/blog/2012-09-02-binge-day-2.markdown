title: Binge Day 2, 3 Plays Submitted
---

I had a sick in bed day yesterday, so today I've got to come out swinging! After all, I've got 30 plays to submit this month (not to mention check over 4,000+ plays for [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/)). Today I've sent three plays to a new play festival in Iowa. [City Circle Acting Company](http://citycircle.org/city-circle-calls-for-new-play-festival-submissions/) is looking for 10 minute plays. They give priority to playwrights from Iowa, and plays that haven't been produced yet. The deadline is October 1st, and they prefer simply sets and costumes. And the best part... No fee, and email submissions. Lovely when things are nice and simply, huh?
