IT'S GAME DAY! The reading of *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* is tonight, kickoff at 8pm, $10 tickets (cash only) at the door. Come out and see what I've been working on all year, my version of the legend of Achilles, complete with football, enslaved cheerleaders, and Helen as a bovine mascot. 

It's a no-brainer, really. The only thing you have to ask yourself is this: Will you root for the Trojans of the Greeks? 

Because it all comes down to tonight!

The Exit Theater is located at [156 Eddy St in San Francisco](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=the+exit+theater+sf&ie=UTF-8&ei=VVx-UqetGYLOiwKY74HIAQ&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg), and if you need additional info check out the facebook event page here: [https://www.facebook.com/events/166435956886604/](https://www.facebook.com/events/166435956886604/)
