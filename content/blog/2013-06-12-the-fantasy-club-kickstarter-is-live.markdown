title: THE FANTASY CLUB Kickstarter Is LIVE
---

The moments has *finally* arrived! [*The Fantasy Club* Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz) is live and we're ready to take your money! Any amount will help, but if you ask me the best deal is donating at $50; you get two tickets *and* chocolates and strawberries to enjoy during the show!

I'm not saying the whole run is going to sell out through kickstarter.... But it might. Stranger things have happened.

Don't delay, give today! Oh, and share, share TONS! 

Thank you!!!!!!!
