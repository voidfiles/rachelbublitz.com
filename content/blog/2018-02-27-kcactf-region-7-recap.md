Last week is a blur of theater, theater, and more theater. It was packed with auditions, new plays, rehearsals, and wonderful conversations. I got to spend time with some of my favorite people on the planet AND meet some new ones. This year's traveling master playwright from the [Dramatist Guild](https://www.dramatistsguild.com/) was [Steve Yockey](http://www.redkingdreaming.com/), who was so insightful with his feedback and also all around a lovely human being, I was especially excited to meet him as I loved his play *MERCURY* at [Salt Lake Acting Company](http://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/) this past Fall (and because I'm a pretty big Supernatural fan (shhhhhh)). And while it was freezing up in Spokane, most of the week we had to brave 10 - 20 degree weather, I had plenty of theater to keep me warm. All in all, I couldn't have asked for more from my last time attending KCACTF Region 7's conference as a student.

My director, DannyLee Hodnett (artistic director of the [Wyoming Theater Festival](https://www.facebook.com/wyomingtheaterfestival/)), and I scored the jack-pot with our actors. I was so impressed how deep they were able to dig in with only two rehearsals over the week.

And then there was all the seeing of theater, which was so great, but I think my butt is going to be sore for another month from all the sitting. Luckily I had the best dates...

This year more than any of the other festivals I've attended there were just SO MANY NEW PLAYS! HUGE thank you to NPP (National Playwriting Program) Chair Benjamin Gonzales and NPP Vice-Chair Jef Peterson for making that happen, because it was the best. Over the week I caught:

* [*SUCIA* by Nicole Jost, which is about to open at San Francisco State University!](https://lca.sfsu.edu/events/2018-03-01-080000-2018-03-11-080000/817581) If you're in the Bay Area go see it so I can live vicariously through you! It runs March 1-11th!
* *WE ARE A POEM* adapted by Jeff Sanders and Sarah Goff from the collected works of John Rybicki and Julie Moulds.
* Two of the Region 7 John Cauble One Act Play Semi-Finalists: *SILICON SOUL* by Ellen MacNary and *PUPPETO AND PUPPETETTE* by Jessie Spangler.
* [*SLEEPY*, a musical, presented by The Lost Children Band, adapted from an Anton Chekhov short story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkwYMer9XyI) 
* *TO TOKOYO AND THE MOON* a beautiful new one-act by Steve Yockey.
* And the 10-Minute Play Festival which included: *H/ECHOS/KES* by Casey Alcoser, *IT'LL BLOW OVER* by Annabel Lewis, *OSCAR THE BEAUTIFUL* by Katherine Gee Perrone, *REFLEXION* by Art Por Diaz, *SOME THINGS ARE JUST SCARIER* by Priscilla Rodriguez, *MY BODY* by me!, and *JUNGLE* also by Art Por Diaz.

Before I even knew the outcome of the competition, I was so proud of the work my actors put in for the reading of *MY BODY*, they totally killed it.

And then it was the waiting game.... I watched the final round of the Irene Ryan Scholarship Competition, the acting competition which keeps the actors busy/nervous/excited all week. I was especially excited to see Corinne Landy in the final round! I had gotten the chance to meet Corinne last September at the Wyoming Theater Festival (she was in [Kenneth Jone](http://www.bykennethjones.com/)'s play [*HOLLYWOOD, NEBRASKA*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/62386/hollywood-nebraska)), and was so excited to have her walk into auditions for the festival on Monday. We cast her, of course, and it was wonderful to spend all week with her as we rehearsed *MY BODY*. 

After the Irene Ryans it was award time. All my nerves came back, as I waited to see if *MY BODY* was moving on to be considered for the National Round.... AND IT DID! For the third time my ten-minute play moved forward as a national semi-finalist!!! Now's the time for everyone to cross their fingers that this time (this *last* time) is the time I make it all the way the Kennedy Center National Conference this coming April. The other ten-minute play that moved forward was *OSCAR THE BEAUTIFUL* by Katherine Gee Perrone!

And that's a wrap. I will, as always, announce from the roof-tops if I get into the next round or not, so stay tuned!!!!
