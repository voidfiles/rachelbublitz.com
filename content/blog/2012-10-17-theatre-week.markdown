I know, every week is theatre week... But this week I seem to be running the gamut on the theatre experience so I thought I'd share...

Last night I saw [Theatre Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/)'s show [LOVE IN THE TIME OF ZOMBIES](https://www.facebook.com/events/469989143022513/) at [Cafe Royale](http://www.caferoyale-sf.com/) in San Francisco. It's a very fun show that'll put you in the Halloween spirit, so don't miss it! There are still 3 more performances; Mon. 10/22, Mon. 10/29, and Tues. 10/30.

On Thursday, I'll be pulling out my pearl necklace and fancy dress to go to the Opera! Yes! I'll be heading over to [The San Francisco Opera](http://sfopera.com/Home.aspx) to see [MOBY-DICK](http://sfopera.com/Season-Tickets/2012-2013-Season/Moby-Dick.aspx)! I am more than a little excited for this. It's Moby Dick the *opera*! I can only imagine how epic this show will be. The tickets are crazy expensive, but if you're still interested it runs this week and next.

And finally this Friday I'm taking the kids to see [Disney on Ice: 100 Years of Magic](http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1C0048E5A0F13316?artistid=830558&majorcatid=10003&minorcatid=22) (is it clear now why I said this week runs the gamut on the theatre experience? Does ice capades counts as theatre???). I have no idea what to expect having never seen a show on ice before. Audrey (my four year old) thinks that there will be glittery dresses and that they will ballet dance on the ice. We shall see my young one, we shall see. There will be $35 ice cream cones, that's for sure... 

Next week is busy for me as well! I have a reading with [Pacifica Table Readers](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Pacifica_table_readers/) on Sunday (they're reading TERRIBLE PEOPLE), [REPRO RIGHTS!](https://www.facebook.com/events/238167012972710/) is on Monday night ([buy tickets today if you haven't already!](https://www.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?e=405c60cb11c033b51ae7b8251f643dab&t=tix)), Tuesday night there's a reading in Washington DC (I won't be there) called [SLUT](https://www.facebook.com/events/202998143167154/) (both REPRO RIGHTS! and SLUT feature my short play called MY BODY), AND [Playwrights Foundation](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/)'s [Rough Reading Series](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=53) continues with a reading of REPARATIONS from [Dominic Orlando](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=288) and I will be there as the associate producer. Yes, that was all one sentence. I'm glad you lived through it. Do I have anything else next week? YES! I have the panel with [Play Cafe](http://www.playcafe.org/), [How To Get Your Work Produced](https://www.facebook.com/events/536745713017958/)... That should be a helpful afternoon.

So yes. Go see some shows! I am.
