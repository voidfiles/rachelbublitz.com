Yesterday we announced a brand new theater festival coming to San Francisco: [LOUD & UNLADYLIKE](http://loudandunladylike.tumblr.com/) presented by [DIVAfest](http://www.theexit.org/divafest/)! My partners in crime are [Claire Rice](http://loudandunladylike.tumblr.com/post/104263385504/meet-claire-rice) and [Tracy Held Potter](http://loudandunladylike.tumblr.com/post/104263390984/meet-tracy-held-potter), the three of us are writing brand new plays inspired by historical women. We have a top notch team all around, our Production Manager is Tonya Narvaez and out Literary Manger/Dramaturg is Roxana Sorooshian.

ALSO, for the 2016 festival we'll be taking proposal submissions starting this January, a model we're borrowing from the brilliant [San Francisco Olympians Festival](sfolympians.com). 

In the next few weeks we'll have more and more announcements about the festival coming toward you, but for now know that we'll run June 25-27, 2015 and July 9-11, 2015 at the [EXIT Theatre](http://www.theexit.org). 

For now, check out more about the festival on our tumblr page: [http://loudandunladylike.tumblr.com/](http://loudandunladylike.tumblr.com/), click on the names of each writer to find out more about them or the historical lady they are using for inspiration!
