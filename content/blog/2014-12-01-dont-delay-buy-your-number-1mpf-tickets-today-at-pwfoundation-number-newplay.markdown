How did December get here so fast? I was still sleeping off all that turkey! Sadly, whether you're ready for it or not, it's December 1st! This means that you only have TWO WEEK until [Playwrights Foundation](playwrightsfoundation.org)'s [5th Annual One-Minute Play Festival](https://www.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&e=1f742d701335425a218b2a69c9a41a55)! The festival takes place December 15th and 16th at [Brava Theater Center](http://www.brava.org/)!

Over FIFTY Bay Area playwrights, TEN Bay Area directors, and a BOAT LOAD of Bay Area actors. Come and see the talent of the Bay Area put up on display!

Get your tickets here: [http://www.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&e=1f742d701335425a218b2a69c9a41a55](https://www.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&e=1f742d701335425a218b2a69c9a41a55)
