title: SF Olympians Festival Opening Party Hours Away
---

At 8pm the artists (writers, directors, actors, and fine artists) involved with this year's festival as the art work for this year is presented, a preview of each play is heard, and free food is served! There will also be drinks, but those will cost you some $. I have a fancy blue dress and some golden slippers ready to go, so join me! Get on your fancy clothes and head down to [The Exit](http://www.theexit.org/)! Party starts at 8pm tonight!

Also in [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) news, the official schedule has been released! Get that here: [http://www.sfolympians.com/?p=1791](http://www.sfolympians.com/?p=1791)

Will I see you tonight? I sure hope so! But if you can't make it, never fear! I'm hoping to take an obnoxious number of photos to post, so check back here for those this weekend!
