This month I've been helping a local Utah farmer dramaturg a six-ish minute story about their life and farm for an event tonight: Food Tank's Voices of Farmers! Her story will be joined by other farmers to make an entire evening.

It's been a really cool experience, my son and I even got to visit the farm, me asking dramaturgy questions, him asking soil questions... My son wants to be a farmer, and so this whole thing has been a big worlds colliding, kismet type of thing. He might even internship on the farm this summer!

Anywho, are you free tonight? We start up in Park City at 7pm. Not afraid of the Sundance crowds? Check us out!
