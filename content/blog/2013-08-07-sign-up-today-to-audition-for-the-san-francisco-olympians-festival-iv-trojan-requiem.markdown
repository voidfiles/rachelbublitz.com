title: 'Sign Up Today To Audition  For The San Francisco Olympians Festival IV: Trojan
  Requiem'
---

September 29th and 30th you have the opportunity to audition for one of the most exciting indie theatre festivals San Francisco has to offer! [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) is holding auditions for [Trojan Requiem](https://www.facebook.com/events/284030435071646/284045881736768/?notif_t=plan_mall_activity), a festival of new works being read this November! I have loved being a part of the writer's group this year, I've met so many exciting local artists! Which is why you should audition! And here is more info from the event page on how to do just that:

>The San Francisco Olympians Festival is returning and will need dozens of actors for its 2013 festival which plays the middle three weeks of November!

>In the month of November in 2013, No Nude Men Productions, one of San Franciscoâ€™s longest running indy theater troupes, will roll out 36 new plays written by 30 local writers, each one focusing on an element of the Trojan War mythos. 

>Each of these 36 plays will receive a dramatic reading at the Exit Theater, and for that we'll need actors, so if you're the kind of person who can act AND read (no, it's not a given), we'd love to have you join us in what promises to be even a bigger success than last year's festival!

>Auditions are September 29, 2 PM to 9 PM, and September 30, 7-10 PM, at the Exit. Please e-mail [sfolympians@gmail.com](mailto:sfolympians@gmail.com) to schedule an audition slot.

>Auditions will consist of reading aloud passages of text we choose ahead of time. Please bring a headshot and resume. Leave yourself at least half an hour to get through the audition process.

>There is a small stipend, determined by attendance each night of the festival (i.e. you get a percentage of the box office). 

>If scheduling permits (and you're interested), all actors will be considered for multiple plays.

>For more information about the festival and the individual plays and authors, check out [www.sfolympians.com](http://www.sfolympians.com/)

>Please pass this on to any actors you may know!

>Sorry, but we can not use AEA performers for this event.

There's also the show schedule on the event page, so be sure to go there for more information and then get your audition slot! Here's the facebook event page:
