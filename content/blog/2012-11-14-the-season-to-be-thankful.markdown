title: The Season To Be Thankful
---

Thanksgiving is a week from tomorrow. I'm heading down south for holiday and birthday (my sister's 40th!!) celebrations on *early* Saturday morning. We're also gearing up to move, we're announcing the plays for [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com), I'm also in the middle of a ton of research for my next project (reading for fun and reading for research are very different (research reading is slooooooow)), and a hundred other things.  What I'm saying is that I will not be posting every day, I know this to be true. But since this is the season of remembering what we're thankful for, I wanted to take a moment and be thankful...

This is going to be super cheese ball... You've been warned.

1. Mi familia. Both near and far, I have some super supportive people on my team. I've gone through a lot of changes this year, and I've needed help so that I could write more. Thank you for stepping up and giving me a hand.

1. Mi amigos. Again, you guys are all over, you've been there to read plays, or essays I need an extra pair of eyes on... Helping me with [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com).... Seeing shows with me... And seeing my shows too! Some of you folks I've known for most of my life, some I've just met... Regardless, it means a lot to me and I am glad to have so many wonderful people in my life.

1. Writing. Cheesy, I know. But I am very thankful for writing, and that starting to write woke me up and reminded me that there's more than watching tv. There's a whole life out there waiting, and I'm glad I started partaking again.

1. The Bay! I really love living in the east bay. I love Oakland, I love San Francisco, and I love Berkeley (where we're moving back to). I'm inspired by your people and your scenery daily. 

I could go on and on and on all day. I enjoy my life immensely. I think I covered the big ones though. What are you thankful for?
