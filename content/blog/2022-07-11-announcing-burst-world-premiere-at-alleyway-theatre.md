Absolutely thrilled to announce the World Premiere of [*Burst*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) at [Alleyway Theatre](https://www.alleyway.com/) this Fall! *Burst* was a [finalist](https://rachelbublitz.com/2022/04/25/burst-is-a-finalist-for-nnpn-2022-showcase/) for the 2022 National New Play Network Showcase, as you may remember, and I really didn't expect 2022 to get even better for *Burst*, but it sure has!

Alleyway Theatre is an associate member of the [National New Play Network](http://nnpn.org/), located in Buffalo, New York. *Burst* will run October 21 - November 12, directed by Daniel Lendzian. I will most likely be out for previews and opening! Near by? Mark your calendars so you remember to come and say hi!

More about actors, designers, and all that good stuff soon, so stay tuned!
