title: Summer Is Over, Time To Work
---

SUMMER IS OVER! 

I know it's not actually over, but I feel like mine is. I've been out of town for over two weeks (minus the three days in between trips), and I managed to fit in a lot on those trips.... One might say all of summer... I went on a road trip, went to the beach, ate ice cream, saw summer-time movies, watched fire-works, read a few funny/light books, slept in, stayed up late, went to TWO baseball games, and wore shorts. I figured that since I'm so busy, I might as well cram in as much frivolous fun in while I could... But I'm back and ready to jump back in to things...

I've got to get a new draft of *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* ready before the end of the month so that I can submit it to [Marin Theatre Company](http://www.marintheatre.org/)'s new play contest, [Aurora](http://www.auroratheatre.org/index.php)'s GAP program, and a few other places... [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/) is around the corner (HAVE YOU SIGNED UP YET?)! And I have a seriously crazy plan for tackling this year's challenge... I still need to find suitable childcare for my kids for when I'm in class... I need to put in my hours on my new play, and I need to tighten up my scripts for BABIES: The Ultimate Birth Control (and we have [auditions](https://www.facebook.com/events/187012014796071/?fref=ts) tonight!).... So, yeah, summer fun is gone... I'm ready for all that hard work fun! Bring it on!
