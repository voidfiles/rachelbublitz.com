title: 10 Resolutions for 2013
---

I've said it a thousand times... I even wrote about it on the blog [once](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2012/01/02/submissions/)... I don't like New Years resolutions. I think that if you want to do something, do it... Don't wait for the new year. But that said, I love to set goals for myself, and I might as well set some of those right now. Here we go:

1. See MORE theatre. In fact, my goal for 2013 is to attend 100 theatre related events (readings count). I got the (huge) number from the awesome [Stuart Bousel](http://dramalist.com/people/2774/stuart-bousel/author/director/actor), who did just that this past year.

2. Publish a book. No big deal, you know... Just publish a book. Ha! Most of the material is there, we just have a lot of grunt work to get through to get the [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com) to the printers. I aim to get it done this year.

3. Produce a podcast. Yep! The 31 top plays that we selected for the anthology will also be read aloud radio play style for the 31 Plays in 31 Days podcast! Super excited to get playwrights work out there to the people, and I think this will be the beginning of more of that. Stay tuned!

4. Write 31 plays this August. I promise, this is the last 31 Plays in 31 Days goal. But this August we'll be running our challenge again, and I fully intend to participate.

5. I want to receive 100 rejection letters this year. I completely stole this goal from the inspiring [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/).

6. I'd like to run a 10k. I did a 5k in 2011, and it was a lot of fun. I'd like to double the distance and double the fun!

7. Read more! Reading makes you a better writer, true story. Looking forward I'd like to up my intake and broaden my horizons.

8. Write more! In addition to writing 31 plays in the month of August, I plan on finishing my play about Achilles for the [2013 SF Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/), rewriting a one act that I wrote last summer, and taking *My Sister's Baby* out of the drawer and fixing it's problems. 

9. See *The Fantasy Club* produced by [All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/). The kick ass [Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2) will be directing and I cannot wait to see what she does with my first completed full length play.

10. Save money. This is a hard one, with two kids there seems like there are constantly things to buy... But we downsized to our apartment and I really want it to pay off. 

11. (It's a bonus resolution/goal!) I also really want to meet and work with new artists.

Cross your fingers for me... Or better yet, help me out! Let me know when and where to attend your theatre event, so I hit my goal!

Happy New Years everyone! Be safe tonight.
