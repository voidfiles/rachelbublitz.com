Hey hey, I got some good news! I've been officially invited to join the [Plan-B Theatre Lab](http://planbtheatre.org/the-Lab/)! Listen to their groovy mission:

>"The Lab is an incubator for new plays, an opportunity for each of the thirteen member playwrights to share whatever script they wish, at whatever stage they wish, in a private table reading for the group. The ultimate goal is two-fold: (1) to continually contribute to the field nationally by strengthening a local community of playwrights and (2) to populate future seasons as often as possible with their work. The Lab is truly an innovative artist community."

The awesome local playwrights I'll be joining in the Lab are: Austin Archer, [Matthew Ivan Bennett](https://newplayexchange.org/users/749/matthew-ivan-bennett), Carleton Bluford, [Elaine Jarvik](https://newplayexchange.org/users/1654/elaine-jarvik), [Julie Jensen](https://newplayexchange.org/users/7849/julie-jensen), [Jenny Kokai](https://newplayexchange.org/users/2116/jennifer-kokai), [Melissa Leilani Larson](https://newplayexchange.org/users/452/melissa-leilani-larson), [Jenifer Nii](https://newplayexchange.org/users/10831/jenifer-nii), [Eric Samuelsen](https://newplayexchange.org/users/10910/eric-samuelsen), [Morag Shepherd](https://newplayexchange.org/users/8040/morag-shepherd), [Rob Tennant](https://newplayexchange.org/users/5971/robert-tennant), and [Debora Threedy](https://newplayexchange.org/users/2323/debora-threedy).

I feel so grateful to invited in to this program. My first month to share is August- I can't wait!
