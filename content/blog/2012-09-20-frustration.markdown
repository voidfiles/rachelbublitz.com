##[FRUSTRATION, a benefit show for Play Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/events/107174879434284/)

Yep! It's coming up! If you forgot the line up, let me refresh your memory....

TERRIBLE PEOPLE by Rachel Bublitz

THE RITUAL by Rhoda Curtis

THE TROUBLE AT TABLE 23 by Charles Lerrigo

TWO BEDS by Tracy Held Potter

THE BORDERLAND by Bret Rohmer

BACKSLIDING by Earl T. Roske

DON'T LOOK by Lynn Snyder

and

MARRY ME, MOMMY by Ron Weaver

If you know and love me you'll have TWO reasons to come out for the show... Not only will TERRIBLE PEOPLE scene #2 be read (super funny play by the way), but I'll be *directing* the piece from my work wife [Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2)! 

I'm not going to lie... I'm a little nervous. The last piece I directed was... Oh... Crap! It was *seven* years ago. I think it's like riding a bike, or at least I'm hoping it is, but regaurdless I'm going to dive in and take it on! This will be a good warm up for me too... In case you didn't know, I'll be directing [All Terrain Theatre](http://www.allterraintheater.org/)'s show WOMEN IN SOLIDARITY WITH CATS this coming April. Yeah, a warm up will be good.

Okay, you have the information! Come out for the very *FREE* show this Sunday, and if we knock your socks off... Which I'm pretty sure we will... Feel free to donate to [Play Cafe](http://www.playcafe.org/)! A very worthy cause.

Thanks and see you Sunday!
