BBBBBBBBIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGG NNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWSSSSSSSSSSSS!

[Ouvisible Theatre Co.](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/), which produces the [Detroit New Works Festival](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/playwriting-opportunities/newworks/) has just announced that they're moving the World Premiere of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) up to the summer of 2019 because they are *so excited about my play and cannot wait to produce it*!!! AND I get to keep my cast from the reading! [Anna Doyle](https://www.annadoyleactor.com/), [Michael Lopetrone](http://www.michaellopetrone.com/), and Scott Anthony Joy are all coming back to reprise their roles!

So it's back to Detroit for me next summer! More pie! More awesome museums! MORE THEATER!
