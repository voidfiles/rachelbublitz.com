Yesterday was the first rehearsal for *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats*! It went VERY well. Everyone was laughing, having a good time, and digging into the script. I made even MORE edits, and now I'm hoping the script will finally be as stream-lined as it needs to be for the reading on Saturday! I took a bunch of pictures, to see them all check out the facebook album: [https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.226955497428804.1073741835.108943545896667&type=1&l=e055546680](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.226955497428804.1073741835.108943545896667&type=1&l=e055546680).

AND make SURE you come on Saturday! This script is getting tighter and stronger every day, and we are ready to put on a SHOW! I couldn't be happier with all the people involved, and I very much want to share all of my work, and theirs, with you.

*Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* will be read *THIS* Saturday, November 9th at 8pm at the [Exit] in San Francisco. If you want more details, or you'd like to RSVP, do that here: [https://www.facebook.com/events/166435956886604/](https://www.facebook.com/events/166435956886604/).
