Absolutely thrilled to announce that a production of [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/browse/the-night-witches) is joining the line-up for the [2026 International Thespian Festival](https://itf.schooltheatre.org/?_gl=1*1ye3l0n*_ga*ODIyNTExMzEyLjE3NzE0MzcyNDM.*_ga_M1QY898KBK*czE3NzE0MzcyNDMkbzEkZzEkdDE3NzE0Mzc3MjAkajQyJGwwJGgw) this June! *The Night Witches* will be one of three plays, along with nine musicals, presented as main stage productions during the festival. Erin Gorman Tavernier directed this invited production by [Deane Bozeman School](https://www.instagram.com/dbsdrama/) from Panama City, Florida.

The International Thespian Festival is presented by the [Educational Theatre Association](https://schooltheatre.org/). The 2026 festival will take place at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. I'm strongly considering attending the festival  myself, seems like an opportunity that I can't pass up! I hope everyone involved is as proud of themselves as I am of them! Huge congratulations to all of the cast and crew... And maybe see you in Indiana?

Happy Friday!
