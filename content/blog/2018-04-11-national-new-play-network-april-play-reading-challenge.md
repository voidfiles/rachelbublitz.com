Still in major catch-up mode, and one of the things I'm trying to catch up on is the [National New Play Network](http://nnpn.org/)'s April Play Reading Challenge! It's pretty simple, read a whole lot of new plays this month on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard), recommend the ones you like, and then [fill out the #NewPlay April Reader Responses google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezBOsFEj5Vfp3wDvn6k1w-0dVivE0afyVFOf6mVSGPntJKzw/viewform) for each play you read and recommend! If you're one of the top twenty readers you'll get a nifty "I â™¥ New Plays" button! This has my name written all over it, because I love challenges, new plays, AND buttons. I missed a week beaching it up in Hawaii though, so I've got a lot of reading and recommending ahead of me!

Here are the eight plays I've recommended so far this month:

* ["*Mamie & Martin Go to Bed*" by Kat Ramsburg](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/14565/mamie-martin-go-bed)
* [*"N"* by Adrienne Earle Pender](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/66592/n)
* ["*TOOLS*" by Emma Goldman-Sherman](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/90806/tools)
* ["*IN TRAINING*" by Rachael Carnes](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/168839/training)
* ["*Tiny Baby*" by Eric Pfeffinger](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/37584/tiny-baby)
* ["*A Growing Problem*" by Jeanette Farr](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/24820/growing-problem) 
* ["*Fulfillment Center*" by Jeanette Farr](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/147736/fulfillment-center)
* ["*Agent Kilikili's Mom and his Male Order Bride*" by Conrad A. Panganiban](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/17508/agent-kilikilis-mom-and-his-male-order-bride)

Hoping to keep up this pace, and hoping it's enough for one of those awesome buttons!

Yay new plays!
