title: Nap Time, a ten minute play
---

In an effort to warm up for my 31 plays in 31 days extravaganza this August, I'm writing one play a day for the next five days. (It's like running, you can't just decide to run a marathon the day of the marathon!) Today I wrote a short play called "Nap Time" I'm hoping to submit it to Fringe of Marin. Want to know more? Shoot me an email, I'd love to get some feedback on it.
