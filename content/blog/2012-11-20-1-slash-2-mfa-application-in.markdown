title: 1/2 MFA Application In
---

I'm 1/2 way there! Well, 1/2 way turned in. I just submitted my MFA application through SFSU, when I get back from my holiday travel, I'm visiting family in southern California, I will delivery my manuscript, the department application, and my letters of recommendation.... And then the waiting games begin! Make sure and keep your fingers crossed until I hear the news. It's only a few months, don't worry about it.
