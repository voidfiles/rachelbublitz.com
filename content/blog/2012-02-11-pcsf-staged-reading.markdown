title: PCSF Staged Reading
---

Great news in the inbox today. The Playwright's Center of San Francisco has selected "The Fantasy Club" to be in their Spring Reading Series. Some of the comments I received: 

"The dialog sparkles."

"I look forward to seeing this one as a staged reading. It is clear the playwright has 
reworked this piece and it is very producible.  Nice work."

"The characters are diverse and likable.  Good arcs present and 
the protagonist's obstacles many times lie with herself. Snappy dialogue."

I will post the date as soon as I know it!
