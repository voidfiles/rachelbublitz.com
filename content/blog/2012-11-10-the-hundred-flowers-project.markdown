So excited! Tonight is the night I'll finally get to see the full production version of [*The Hundred Flowers Project*](http://www.crowdedfire.dreamhosters.com/2012-season/the-hundred-flowers-project/). I saw a reading over the summer of it during [Playwrights Foundation](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=1)'s Bay Area Playwrights Festival, and I was blown away. I can't wait to see it with all the tech support! And it's gotten such amazing reviews.... Tonight is going to be *so* good!
