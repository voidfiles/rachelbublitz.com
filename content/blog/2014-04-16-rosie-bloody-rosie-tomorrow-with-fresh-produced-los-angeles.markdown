title: ROSIE, BLOODY ROSIE Tomorrow With Fresh Produce'd Los Angeles

Oh my goodness, where has April gone? This month is moving by with light-speed! It's already the 16th, which means tomorrow is my big/exciting LA adventure!

Tomorrow, in West Hollywood, at 7:30pm, an excerpt of my horror play *Rosie, Bloody Rosie* will be read, for the first time, in front of an audience! My good friend, [Chris Reed]() is my director! My cast includes: Elitia Daniels, Riva Di Paola, Courtney Clark, Charlie Morgan Patton and Jamie Pettito! It's going to be so good! And so scary!

Here's all the info:
