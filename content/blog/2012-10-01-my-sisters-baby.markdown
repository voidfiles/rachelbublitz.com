title: MY SISTER'S BABY
---

I sure hope you're coming out tonight for the reading of MY SISTER'S BABY. The banana bread is baking in the oven as I type, and it smells delicious. Come down, give me your two scents, and eat some tasty food! It starts at 7:30, and it's $10 at the door.

See you there!
