Do I have a title? No! But that doesn't stop me from having a date for the reading! Yes, you heard right, mark your calendars, Tuesday, July 29th, my new full-length based loosely on the the myth of Pegasus will be getting a staged reading at [Custom Made Theatre Co.](http://custommade.org/)! Mark them up, and be prepared, because it is going down!

I don't have much more info now about the reading, as we get closer I'll let you know who my director is, and who my actors are, and hopefully even what the play is called! 

So stay tuned!
