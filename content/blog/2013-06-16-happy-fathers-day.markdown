title: Happy Father's Day
---

Today is both [Bloomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday) *and* Father's Day! Which is fitting because my dad love's James Joyce.

I just went on a walk with my daughter and husband, she's learning to ride her bicycle without training wheels. It's hard for her because she has to practice, and she wants to be good instantly at everything. I watch as my husband thoughtfully argued against her 5-year-old logic, trying to get back up and try again after she had fallen... In the end, he failed. But I'm not sure I would have put in so much effort. I am grateful that there are two of us, and for the things that he makes up for which I lack.

It got me thinking about my dad, and the things that I can thank him for... He used to read *Just So Stories* to me as bed time stories, my favorite was "The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo." I asked for it almost every night. My dad also bought me *King Lear* when I was in sixth grade, and he talked me through all the parts I was confused by. He also bought me *Grendel* by John Gardner, *In Watermelon Sugar* by Richard Brautigan, *Moby Dick*, and many other books and plays over the years. I never could read *Moby Dick*, but *Grendel*, and *In Watermelon Sugar* are two of my all time favorite books. He was also one of the first people I told when I started writing *The Fantasy Club*, and he was the third person I sent it to to read. He's one of my biggest fans, and makes me feel like there's nothing else that I should be doing.

I hope both the dads in my life have a great day today, I'm glad you are in my life.
