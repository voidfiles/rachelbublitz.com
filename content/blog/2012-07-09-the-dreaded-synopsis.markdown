title: The Dreaded Synopsis
---

I hate writing synopsis'. Especially for "The Fantasy Club." I'm not sure if it's because it's my first play, or because I've written and rewritten them so many times that I'd rather shove sharp objects in my eyes than work on it ever again. But, sigh, I want to get "The Fantasy Club" produced, and an awesome, eye-popping, attention-grabbing synopsis can help with that, and sharp objects will only lead to hospital trips (and that leads to hospital bills). I get why it's important, especially when it goes off alone with only a sample, and you need the folks on the other end to like it enough that they want the entire script. Maybe it's that pressure. I've yet to send off a 10 page sample and a synopsis and get a request for the whole script. And [Marin Theatre Co.'s](http://marintheatre.org/) has some amazing theatre awards coming up that I'm planning on submitting to. And more than anything (well I'd like to win, obviously), I'd like them to request the whole script from me. So that's where I'm at. 

I almost can't believe I'm about to do this (that's how embarrassed I am about my synopsis writing skills)... But whatever. Here's the newest synopsis that I wrote today:

>"“The Fantasy Club” follows Frances and her quest to discover who she is outside of being a wife and mother. Motherhood has so many more pitfalls to it than raising children. Women have to redefine who they are, and decide what about who they used to be will be left behind in their lives. And as your children grow, and they need you less, what you take back as your own? These are the questions haunting Frances. She’s started writing poetry again, poetry inspired by sexual fantasies. Soon she’s set face to face with the object of these fantasies and is given the opportunity to try them out in real life. Are mothers more than their motherhood? And will Frances risk her family for her fantasy?"

I don't know if this works or not. Any feedback, tips, tricks, or words of wisdom would be cherished. I might even back you a pie! If you didn't know, I make a damn tasty cherry pie. [Email](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) me any thoughts!
