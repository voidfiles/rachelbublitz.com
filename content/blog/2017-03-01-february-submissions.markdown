title: February Submissions
---

Goodbye February, hello March! My submission total for last month was a meager 13. I'm like the pace they always recommended for you to travel at in Oregon Trail so that one of your comrades wouldn't die from typhoid. But adding 13 to January's robust 42, I get a total of 55 submissions for the year, which is a pretty respectable number. Hoping to pick it up in March. Think organized and dedicated thoughts for me, and I just might make it through. 

I'm thinking... I'm thinking I might have a large and stupid submission goal this year...
