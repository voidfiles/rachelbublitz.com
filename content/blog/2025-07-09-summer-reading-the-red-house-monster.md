Another week of summer is in the books! Next up on your summer reading list is my one-act thriller: [*The Red House Monster*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/the-red-house-monster), available with [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/). *The Red House* monster is inspired by one of Hercules' labors and Shirley Jackson's "We Have Always Lived in This Castle," and was originally commissioned by the [San Francisco Olympians Festival](https://sfolympians.com/geryon/). This one-act play has a special place in my heart, and has really been picking up steam with productions the past few years. Why should you give it a read? Well, so glad you asked...

#### Looking for a one-act for competition?

*The Red House Monster* runs between 35 and 45 minutes, and has a cast between 4-5, making it an excellent option for a one-act competition. Last year a production in Canada made it all the way to Provincials!

#### Looking for a not-funny thriller?

I am sure that if you looked close enough you'd find something to chuckle at in *The Red House Monster*, but for the most part it is chillingly atmospheric and eerie. Steeped in legend and lore, this play asks what makes a hero. And, as an excellent creepy bonus, the play has its own disturbing lullaby! Nothing gives me goosebumps better than a low and slow creepy lullaby.

#### Looking for a play that blends mythology and classic literature?

One of my favorite aspects to *The Red House Monster*, is how much room there is for digging. The play can easily be studied through the lens of a Greek mythology adaptations, or as a deep dive into pieces inspired by the legend Shirley Jackson. But there's more, a theme in the play, as well as where the play took its inspiration, is how heroes and monsters are classified, as well as the lenses we use to examine these individuals.

#### Looking for a play with a majority, or completely, female cast?

Not only is this a majority, or completely, female cast, but the roles available are meaty and complex. Two sisters, as different as night and day, their incredibly proud and demanding mother, as well as the monster herself! The role of Sheriff can be played by any gender.

Here's the synopsis of *The Red House Monster*:

>*The story of Hannah Gold, a young lady living on an island off the coast of Massachusetts in the late 1800s, and the night that changed her life. Filled with small town lore, haunted houses, spirits, monsters, pistols, pie, and mysteries, it is a play that will keep you guessing just what is in the Red House, and who, in fact, you should be afraid of. Inspired by the myth of Geryon and Hercules, and Shirley Jackson's* We Have Always Lived in This Castle.

*The Red House Monster* runs between 35 and 45 minutes, has a cast of 4 or 5, (4-5 she/her, 0-1 he/his), and you can find it with [Stage Partners right here](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/the-red-house-monster)!

Happy Wednesday!
