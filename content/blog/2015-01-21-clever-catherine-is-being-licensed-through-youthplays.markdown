title: CLEVER CATHERINE Is Being Licensed Through YouthPLAYS
---

My thirty minute children's play CLEVER CATHERINE, adapted from the Italian folk tale "Sly Country Lass," is being licensed through [YouthPLAYS](http://youthplays.com/index.php)! That means folks from all over can find it on their website or in the catalogs and order it for performance or to read! I just went over the proof copy, fixing the typos with an editor, and soon it will be available for purchase! Rest assured that I will let you know the moment that is the case.
