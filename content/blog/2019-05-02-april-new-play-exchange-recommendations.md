It's already the *second* day of May! [*RIPPED* opens at Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow) in only 20 days (eeeeeeeeeeeeee!)...

But also, this is a great time to look back and see all the plays I recommended over the month of April on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard)!

My April New Play Exchange recommendations:

* [*Esther Choi and the Fish that Drowned* by Stephanie Kyung Sun Walters](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/348650/esther-choi-and-fish-drowned)  
* [*Two Henrys* by Kenneth Jones](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/22186/two-henrys)  
* [*The Way North* by Tira Palmquist](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/168680/way-north)
* [*Art & Class* by Matthew Ivan Bennett](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/375940/art-class)

Four new full length plays that I encourage you to check out! I feel like you can really gauge how busy I am by how many plays I'm able to read... April was *busy busy busy* as you can see. Excited to see/read more this month though!
