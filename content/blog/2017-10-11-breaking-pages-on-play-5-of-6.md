I just wrote the first line of my new play *BURST*, which will probably change before anyone will get to read it, but it's a great feeling. Second only to getting to the *end of play* part of a first draft. I spent my day researching and outlining which never makes me feel as accomplished as being able to clock in those page counts. So, before I signed out for the day and head to collect children and then taxi them around to their various activities, I wrote the first line: "*Hi. I'm Sarah. Sarah Boyd.*" 

*BURST* is inspired by the collapse of the tech company Theranos. This play will take place in ONE CONTINUOUS SCENE, which I've never done before, so wish me luck! I have an internal deadline for draft numero uno set for October 25th, just 14 days away. 

Can I do it? Guess we'll find out.
