title: 'Back From Vacation, Binge Day #19'
---

It's the 19th of March already! Oy, I am behind on my binge. I went away to Southern California last week, my older sister had a baby girl so I came down to help and cook for a few days. But I'm back now, and trying to catch up! Let's see how far I can get...

I submitted *Mother Of The Year*, a ten minute play to [SF Theatre Pub's Pint Sized Play Fest](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/category/shows/pint-sized-plays/). The want plays that take place within the amount of time it takes to drink a beer with a ten minute, and three character maximum. Also, all plays must take place in a bar. Deadline is April 15th, 2013.

I sent in an updated draft of my full length play *My Sister's Baby* to [Artemisia](http://www.artemisiatheatre.org/p/artemisia-calls-for-submissions-2013.html). They are seeking scripts for their Fall Staged Reading Series, and want those scripts to have at least one strong female character. Plays must be full length, and their deadline is April 1st, 2013.

[Pegasus Theater Co.](http://www.pegasustheater.com/) is looking for 10 minute plays for their summer short play festival, and I sent them *Horny Like The Wolf*, and *Brothers That Lie Together*. You can submit up to two plays, and the deadline is also April 1st, 2013.

[Play-Makers Spokane](http://nycp.blogspot.com/2013/03/hit-run-vii.html) seeks plays 10-15 minutes in length, about any topic but must be family friendly. I sent them *Garbage Disposal*, which just might be my only family friendly play.

Over in Kentucky, [Somerset Community College](http://legacy.somerset.kctcs.edu/SRESOURCE_Theatre_Opportunities.html) wants comedic plays between 5 and 15 minutes without any profanity or sexual content. I also sent *Garbage Disposal* their way.

And finally, I sent [The Blue Slipper Theatre](http://blueslipper.com/) two ten minute plays; *Horny Like The Wolf* and *Nap Time*. The deadline for their 2nd Annual 10-Minute Play Festival is May 17th, 2013.

So that's 14 plays submitted so far this month. Couple more power submitting days like today and I'll be golden!
