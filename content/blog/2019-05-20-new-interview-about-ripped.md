[Kenneth Jones](https://www.bykennethjones.com/), a playwright hero of mine, interviewed me on his blog for the upcoming opening of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped)! Kenneth Jones wrote [*ALABAMA STORY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/17115/alabama-story), [*HOLLYWOOD, NEBRASKA*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/62386/hollywood-nebraska), [*TWO HENRY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/22186/two-henrys), and many other works. He's an incredible writer and such a giving artist. I am touched that he read *RIPPED*, and wanted to interview me about it on his website.
