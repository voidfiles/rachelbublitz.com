title: New Draft Of GOLDEN CLEATS Done, And Other News
---

I tried to put it down, but that was impossible... So now after tinkering for weeks my full length play about Achilles *Golden Cleats* (I shortened the name) has a new draft! I LOVE it. Trying to put a living room read together for this coming June, it'd be nice to have one more revision before the staged reading on November 9th (which you all should have in your calendar by now, seriously, write it in).

Now I'll be moving on to finishing a new draft of *Terrible People* a 30 minute, 4 woman play. [Playwright's Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/) will feature *Terrible People* in their [Spring Reading Series](http://playwrightscentersf.org/#readingseries) which starts May 6th. The staged reading of *Terrible People* will be July 1st, and [Lisa Drostova](https://twitter.com/drostova) will be directing it! 

Also, dates for the summer production of *The Fantasy Club* will be coming soon!
