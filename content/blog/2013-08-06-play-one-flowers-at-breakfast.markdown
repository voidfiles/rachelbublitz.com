title: Play One FLOWERS AT BREAKFAST
---

Oh, I am SO tired and exhausted! Opening a play is busy times! But *The Fantasy Club* was so much fun this weekend, I hope you get the chance to come this weekend if you missed the show so far. 

Here is my FIRST play for [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/)... Yes, I know I am very behind. I'm not too stressed about it though, my plan is to catch up this week before closing weekend. Want to read it? You know you do... It's just a one-minute play, so you can handle it.

###*Flowers At Breakfast* by Rachel Bublitz

A one-minute play.

*Characters:*

*Hank*, male, any race, mid thirties to mid fifties. June’s father. Sad, lonely, probably wears flannel.

*June*, female, any race, mid teens to mid twenties. Angry, and self reliant. June doesn’t need anyone.

*Setting:*

A crappy diner.


*JUNE and HANK are on stage.*

HANK
I brought you flowers.

JUNE
I see that.

HANK
Do you like them?

JUNE
They’re fine.

HANK
It’s good to see you.

JUNE
Right.

HANK
It is.

JUNE
Well, thanks for breakfast.

HANK
You’re leaving?

JUNE
I have class.

HANK
Can I see you again?

JUNE
What’s the point?

HANK
I’m your father.

JUNE
Could have fooled me.

*JUNE exits. End of play.*
