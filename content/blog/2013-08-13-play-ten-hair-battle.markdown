title: Play Ten, HAIR BATTLE, @31plays31days
---

I am behind on my 31 plays. I'm trying to catch up this week and maybe get even get ahead in the game, we'll see. *They Fantasy Club* closed on Sunday, so I no longer have a good excuse! So, today I'm writing many plays. Here's my wake up play....

####*Hair Battle*, a short play by Rachel Bublitz

Characters:

Sarah, f, 30s-40s, any race. Barbara’s daughter-in-law.

Barbara, f, 50s-70s, any race. Sarah’s mother-in-law.

Setting:

A bedroom or living room.

Time:

Now.

*BARBARA and SARAH are on stage.*

SARAH
It’s time to brush your hair.

BARBARA
NO!

SARAH
I’ll be gentile.

BARBARA
NO!

SARAH
But we need to get those snarls out.

BARBARA
NO!

SARAH
Please sit down. Look, I have to brush your hair, Barbara.

BARBARA
You’ll hurt me!

SARAH
That’s not true. I already told you, I’m going to be gentile.

BARBARA
Where’s Frank? I want Frankie!

SARAH
Frank has work.

BARBARA
He loves me best.

SARAH
I love you too Barb.

BARBARA
Frankie brushes my hair better.

SARAH
He has to work. He can’t brush your hair today, but I can.

BARBARA
NO! I HATE YOU!

SARAH
Please stop, Barbara, sit down, please. 

BARBARA
I don’t want you to brush my hair.

SARAH
I know. But I’ll be soft, it’ll be nice.

BARBARA
You’re not nice.

SARAH
You’re only other option is to have short hair. Should we go and get you a hair cut?

BARBARA
NO! My hair is long.

SARAH
Then sit down.

BARBARA
But-

SARAH
(*Interrupting*) Or maybe I can just cut it off myself? Where are those scissors...

BARBARA
No! NO! NO! NO! I’m sitting now, see?

SARAH
Thank you.

*SARAH brushes BARBARA’s hair.*

SARAH (*CONTINUED*)
That’s not so bad, right?

BARBARA
It hurts.

SARAH
Pain is apart of life Barbara. If anyone should know that, it’s you.

*End of play.*
