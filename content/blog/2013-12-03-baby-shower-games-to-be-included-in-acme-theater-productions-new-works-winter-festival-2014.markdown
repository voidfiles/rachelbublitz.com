title: BABY SHOWER GAMES To Be Included In Acme Theater Productions' New Works Winter
  Festival 2014
---

Back from a fabulous vacation, where maybe a little less writing and reading happened, but a whole lot of family time happened, so all is well with the world.

And I come back with fun announcements! My short play *Baby Shower Games*, which was first produced by [All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/) for our [SF Fringe](http://www.sffringe.org/) show BABIES: THE ULTIMATE BIRTH CONTROL, is moving on to a production in Maynard Massachusetts! *Baby Shower Games* will join the line-up for [Acme Theater Productions](http://www.acmetheater.com/index.asp)' New Works Winter Festival 2014! The dates are January 10, 11, 17, 18, 2014, with all shows at 8pm.

I will announce more information as the date gets closer! If you're in the area, be sure to check out the festival!
