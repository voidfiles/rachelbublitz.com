And everyone who was anyone had a flying car.

Well, not really.

But it is 2020! I hope the last bit of 2019 was joyous and restful for you, and that a nice cup of hot tea was always within an arm's reach.

I have SO many things to tell you! Unfortunately not all the beans are quite ready to be spilled, but but but a bunch are!...

### Another Staged Reading of *BURST*

[*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) was selected for the Mach 33 Festival of New Science-Drive Plays presented by [Pasadena Playhouse](https://www.pasadenaplayhouse.org/) and [Caltech](http://tacit.caltech.edu/mach33)! I will be heading out to Pasadena in early April. Stay tuned for a lot more about this festival!

### So Much Love For *RIPPED*

This fantastic turn of events is getting a whole post to itself, but for now I will just say that I am THRILLED that [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/)'s production of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) ended up on THREE different lists of the best Bay Area Theater of 2019! Check back for all the details and squeals coming soon....

### First Production of *I SAID RUN.*

[*I SAID RUN.*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/370845/i-said-run) will get its first production later this month at Redwood Day School in Oakland, California! Very excited for this short horror play to get a production, I've long thought that students would have a blast with this play.

### Hitting the Road

In just two weeks I'll be going on my first trip of 2020! I'm the guest artist for the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival Region 5 Conference this year! I'll be teaching a few workshops, consulting with students, and developing my play [*FUNNY, LIKE AN ABORTION*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion).

And there's more! More that I cannot tell you about yet. But as soon as the contracts are signed and things are official I will be singing all the good news from all the roof tops. Stay tuned!!!

Happy New Year!
