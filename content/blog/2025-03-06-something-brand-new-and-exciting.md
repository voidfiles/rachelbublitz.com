I love new projects and brand new ideas. Probably good thing I'm a playwright, because I get to have a lot of both! Lately I've been dreaming up something wild, ambitious, and potentially hilarious. When I start it, it will be my biggest unsupported project in a very long time. I've been wanting to write a full-length Christmas something for a while, and a mashing together of worlds idea came to me that was just weird enough to be potentially amazing.

Am I biting off more than I can chew? Oh yeah.

Will I have to wait to really start until I get a bunch of other projects squared away? Yes again. But my heart is beating so hard for this play, I feel a real fire under my butt to get everything else taken care of so I can get it going.

Will I share more? Well, I've already told you it's Christmas-y, I will add that it's also a bit Shakespeare-y. A Christmastime tragicomedy, in fact. I can't say more about it yet, just know that once I have a first draft I'll be screaming about it from the roof tops, for sure putting it up on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/), and I may just invite you over for pizza in exchange for you reading it out loud for me.

Watch this space! Exciting and ridiculous things are on the way!
