title: Trying To Complete A Year
---

Trying to complete a year? A year in what? What am I talking about? All good questions... It has come to my attention that I have been fortunate enough to have my plays read or produced in every month since this past September! I am more than a little proud about that, but now I realize that if I'm able to fill in a few months, I'll go an entire year with my work being read or produced in every month! With my newest staged reading of *Terrible People* with the [Playwrights' Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/) have to only fill in May, June, and September. Now, this goal in a lot of ways in completely silly... My plays getting selected or not has little to do with anything I do. And even with me submitting like a mad woman I could still fall short.... But a girl can dream, can't she? And isn't that why I'm fool enough to write plays in the first place? And with the next [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/playwrightbinge/) (playwrights challenge themselves to submit a play a day for the months of March and September) around the corner, dream I will! 

So keep your fingers crossed for me as the year moves on! And be sure and check out my [Productions](http://rachelbublitz.com/productions/) tab to see all of my upcoming events.

Keep on dreaming, keep on submitting!

PS

I'm not always this optimistic, you just caught me in one of those moods.
