title: Potty Training and First Drafts
---

No, this isn't clever symbolism... It's just what I'm working on this weekend. Trying to potty train my giant son and finish my first draft of Achilles. And name it. Oy, names are hard. I'm 75 pages in and (spoiler alert) Patroclus just died. Now I just need to make big choices and end it so I can fix all the mistakes. 

My kids are watching *The Care Bears Movie*, it's so terrible that I have to have headphones on in order to think. Oh, and now it's time to change the laundry. This is an odd post. It'll be better tomorrow, I promise.
