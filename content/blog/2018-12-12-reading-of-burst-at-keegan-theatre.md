Next week, December 18th *BURST* will have a staged reading with [Keegan Theatre](https://keegantheatre.com/) in Washington D.C., as part of their [Boiler Room Series](https://keegantheatre.com/about/boiler-room-series/)!!

*BURST* will be directed by [Josh Sticklin](https://keegantheatre.com/team-item/josh-sticklin/), and is totally FREE and open to the public! In/near the capital? I hope you'll come out for *BURST*'s first East Coast reading! The reading will take place Tuesday, December 18th, and will start at 8pm. Here's more about the play:

>Sarah Boyd is an extraordinary human being. Not only did she build her company from scratch using nothing but willpower and fortitude, she also sits on the precipice of truly saving this planet. Because on top of being one of the fastest growing tech companies in history, Tactix, with Sarah at its helm, will usher this planet into the post-plastic era. A time where we need not worry or fret over the great destruction being done to our world from this non-biodegradable foe. With her eyes steady on her next round of funding, Sarah must persevere through a late night interview with a particularly tough reporter, a lawsuit aimed at a person from her past, and the waffling of her CTO. Itâ€™s a heavy load, and Sarah knows that she is the only one great enough to bear it.

Happy Wednesday!
