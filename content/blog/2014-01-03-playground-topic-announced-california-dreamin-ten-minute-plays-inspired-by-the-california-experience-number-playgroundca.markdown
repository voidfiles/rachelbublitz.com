[PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/) has announced the topic for Monday's (1/13) reading, and it is...... CALIFORNIA DREAMINâ€™: Ten-Minute Plays Inspired by the California Experience.

Both LA and Bay Area writers are writing at the same time! Exciting! The Bay Area writers are in a pool, but the LA submissions are still open to anyone living in Los Angeles (for details go to: [http://playground-la.org/submit/](http://playground-la.org/submit/)).

Now get to writing! You only have until Tuesday (1/7) at 2pm!
