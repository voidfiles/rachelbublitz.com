Woke up to some disappointing news this morning, the developmental production of *RIPPED*, which had been scheduled to open tomorrow with The Owl And Cat Theatre, has been canceled. It was the now former Artistic Director and director of the show, Thomas Ian Doyle's, choice to cancel the show, the new Artistic Director, Gabrielle Savrone, let me know. She didn't say why, though I hope to find out. Gabrielle also told me she and the cast are very interested in putting *RIPPED* up with her directing it in a few months from now. We're talking later this week to sort everything all out. I hope to have more information then, for now everything is way way up in the air.

What a rollercoaster being a playwright can be sometimes! Oy.
