title: Don't Hate Me In August
---

The insanity will begin on Wednesday. I wanted to let everyone know that I will be blogging throughout the process, and I'll try to put up some of the plays I'm writing throughout the month. But, I also might ignore emails, calls, and texts. I'm a busy lady, with the kids, the husband, running [31 Plays/31 Days](http://31plays31days.com), and *writing* the 31 plays myself. So, family, friends, and everyone else... Please have patience with me. I'm alive, and I'm not trying to ignore you!
