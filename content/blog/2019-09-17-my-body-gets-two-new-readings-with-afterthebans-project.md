If you've been crossing your fingers and just hoping for a performance of my ten-minute play [*MY BODY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2541/my-body) to happen in a theater near you, this might just be your lucky day!.... *MY BODY* joins the work of playwrights around the country in an evening of plays about body rights. #AfterThe Bans is the brainchild of the brilliant writer [Alyson Mead](https://newplayexchange.org/users/2033/alyson-mead), who collected work, put it together in a cohesive package, and stared submitting it out to theaters.

Coming up soon are these two performances of the plays:

Sunday, September 29th & Monday, September 30th – [Strada Company](https://www.stradacompany.org/), Tucson, AZ

Saturday, October 5th - [#NoDominion Theater](https://www.facebook.com/pg/NoDominionTheatre/posts/) – Jersey City, NJ

If you're no where near either Jersey City or Tucson, you still might luck out! #AfterTheBans is being considered by theaters all over, and I will be updating the locations of readings as they are confirmed.

And, if you just can't wait for either of these readings and need to experience the play right this very minute, you can check it out on my [New Play Exchange page](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz). It's my most produced and performed play to date, and one of my most recommended!

Happy Tuesday!
