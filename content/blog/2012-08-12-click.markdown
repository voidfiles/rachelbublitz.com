title: Click, Clack, Moo
---

I took my two little monsters to see "CLICK, CLACK, MOO" at Fairyland today. They actually sat and watched all 90 minutes of it, impressive! It got me thinking about children's theatre though. I always assumed that it's something I wouldn't ever be able to write for (I have a hard time not using profanity) but after seeing one of my kid's favorite books adapted I'm thinking it just might be possible. I will have to do some investigating, but there's this book of theirs I love called *The Paper Bag Princess* that would make a wonderful play, I already am trying to figure it out in my head. I'll probably need music, because kids love dancing and singing, not sure what I'll do... And I'm also not sure if I can just adapt the book without permission, or if I have to contact the author first. We shall see... New adventure!
