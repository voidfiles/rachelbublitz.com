title: MOM'S HAM Was A Blast
---

I can't stop smiling today, because I can't stop thinking of last night! *Mom's Ham* at [PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/)'s (Twisted) HOLIDAY EXTRAVAGANZA was fantastic! I had a superb group of actors ([Lisa Morse](http://lisamorse.info/), Mark Rafael Truitt, [Valerie Weak](http://www.valerieweak.com/), [Lindsey Marie Schmeltzer](https://www.backstage.com/lindseyschmeltzer/), [Soren Oliver](http://www.mccarter.org/ticketoffice/artistdetail.aspx?artist_id=99975548&event_id=3303), and [Tyler Kent](http://www.tylerkent.com/about.html)), and an amazing director, [Jennifer King](http://www.jenniferkingdirector.com/). AND, the house at the Rhoda (at [Berkeley Rep](berkeleyrep.org)) was filled with a wonderful audience. It was the largest audience I've ever had see my work, and adding all those things up together equals a very thankful/happy playwright! I can't think of a better way to bring this year to a close!

What will 2014 have in store? I can't wait to find out!
