Thrilled to announce that *Burst* will be published with [Dramatic Publishing](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/)! *Burst* had a beautiful World Premiere last year with [Alleyway Theatre](https://www.alleyway.com/), and has another production coming up in 2024 with [Relative Theatrics](https://www.relativetheatrics.com/).

Getting *Burst* published will mean it can reach many more people, I'm hoping that translates to lots of productions. I know [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches) get a lot of attention with Dramatic Publishing, fingers crossed its no different for *Burst*.

Stay tuned, I'll be sure to post when it's ready and available!
