title: Interviews and Winning
---

[Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2) and myself were interviewed this morning for the [Arts in The Valley](http://artsinthevalley.wordpress.com/) radio show! Arts in the Valley, hosted by [Kim McMillon](https://twitter.com/arthouseflower/) on 1480 KYOS in Merced, CA, and we'll be on it this coming Saturday. Oh man, I was so nervous this morning. But we did a good job. We were promoting [The 31 Plays in 31 Days Project](www.31plays31days.com), which has gotten up to 167 playwrights! There are still 13 more days left until the challenge begins, so be sure to register soon. 

In other news, I won two flex passes to the [Bay Are Playwrights Festival](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=263)! How rad is that? It must be my lucky day, I didn't sound like a fool in my interview AND I won tickets to an incredibly exciting event. Not sure how I'm going to work out going to see four readings this weekend (I'm camping next weekend, yikes!) but I remain optimistic. Let me know if you want to babysit my kids! HAHA.... No, really, let me know.
