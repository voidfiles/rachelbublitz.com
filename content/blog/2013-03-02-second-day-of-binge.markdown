title: Second Day of Binge
---

Today is also the second day of [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/playwrightbinge/)! During the months of March and September each playwright aims to submit 30 plays within that month. I am a big fan of anything that makes me send my work out, so I'll be participating for sure. I'm already behind though, I don't think I'll get anything in today, and I didn't get anything out yesterday... But never fear! I work best under pressure and I'm confident I'll make up for lost time. If you're also participating, good luck! I had a lot of success come out of last September's binge. Get on it!
