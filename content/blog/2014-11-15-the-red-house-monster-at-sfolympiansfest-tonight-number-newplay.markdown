title: 'THE RED HOUSE MONSTER @SFOlympiansFest TONIGHT #newplay'
---

The time has come! THE RED HOUSE MONSTER, a play that I've been developing for the past year will be put in front of an audience for the FIRST TIME! Will you be in that influential audience? Well that's for you to decide. My play is spooky and dark, a play about a small town and the monsters and heroes that inhabit it.

GERYON or THE RED HOUSE MONSTER will join a brand new one-act by Veronica Tijoe, MINOTAUR or THE STRING'S THE THING, that's right you get TWO plays for the price of one! And don't forget about our wonderful casts!

In THE RED HOUSE MONSTER, directed by Ariel Craft you'll see: Megan Briggs (Stage Directions), Jan Gilbert (Mother Gold/Geryon), Maria Leigh (Hannah Gold), Eden Neuendorf (Cora Gold), and Ron Talbot (Sheriff).

In THE STRONG'S THE THING, directed by Veronica Tijoe, you'll see: Kelvyn Mitchell (Stage Directions), Sunee Kiernan (Aster), and Gabrielle Poccia (D).

It's a Monster Death Battle, so at the end of the night you the audience will vote for their favorite play, and we'll be forced to slaughter the losing monster, big choices tonight people, big choices. 

Tickets are $10, at the door, and it's CASH ONLY! House opens at 7:30, show's at 8pm at [the Exit](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Exit+Theatre/@37.784382,-122.410236,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xff033a4836b97ed8?sa=X&ei=Cn1nVLnwGqKIigK2-oCoBg&ved=0CKYBEPwSMBE) in SF. 

Did I mention I'm bringing pie? AND this pie might be raffled off at the end of the night, so really, can you miss this night? I don't think so.
