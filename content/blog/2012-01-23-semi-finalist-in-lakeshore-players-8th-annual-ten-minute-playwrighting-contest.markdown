title: Semi-Finalist in Lakeshore Players' 8th Annual Ten-Minute Playwrighting Contest!
---

Yay! "The Anniversary" is in the top 40 our of 350 submissions for the Lakeshore Players' 8th Annual Ten-Minute Playwrighting Contest! They'll be announcing the top 20 in March, and the top 20 will receive a full production in June. It's in Minnesota, and I think if I get in I'll be trying my hardest to get out there for the performance. This would be the first time my work has been produced. Fingers crossed! But I am pretty excited to be in the top 40. That's 2 places that have accepted my work.
