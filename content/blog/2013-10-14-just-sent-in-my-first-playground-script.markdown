title: Just Sent In My First PlayGround Script
---

THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH, was announced Friday as [PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/)'s first topic in the [2013/2014 Monday Night Reading Series](http://www.playground-sf.org/boxoffice/#mondaynightplayground). I wrote my first play Friday afternoon, after a great deal of thought and care.... But then, Friday evening roles around and I scrapped the whole thing after reading [this infuriating article](http://themattwalshblog.com/2013/10/09/youre-a-stay-at-home-mom-what-do-you-do-all-day/) (PS, if you're reading this via FB, click through for links!).

I read that, got mad, and started writing. After a few hours I realized that this new play (now titled *The Most Important*), was the script I needed to focus on, and focus on it, I did! I have had five generous souls read and give me feedback on the script, gone through a half-dozen drafts (give or take), and then boom! Done. Or as done as I'll be in the next day. I have until 2pm tomorrow, but since I have class, and since I am extremely paranoid that I might someone forget to send my script in, I sent it in tonight. I really love how the play came together too, and I have to say, regardless if it is selected for next Monday's reading, I sent in something I feel great about. And what more can you really ask for, right?

So cross your fingers, and cross your toes that *The Most Important* by Rachel Bublitz is in the line-up this coming Monday!

I will be there on [Monday (10/21) for PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/monday.shtml)'s first reading, if I get in our not, AND YOU SHOULD BE TOO! I very much hope to see you there!
