I've been given the green light to announce one (of possibly *three*) future productions of [*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches)! Coming March, 2020 the [Egyptian YouTheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) will produce *THE NIGHT WITCHES* in their brand new black box space up in Park City, Utah. And, even more exciting, I'm expanding the script to a full-length for this production and adding in two additional characters!

It's been so rewarding working on this play, and while I don't think I have any other piece that would work like this, *THE NIGHT WITCHES* will eventually have a total of three different lengths... A thirty five minute version (very popular for those one-act competitions!), a 50-60 minute version, both of these will continue with the cast of nine, and now a super sized 75-80 minute version with a cast of 11!

I am hoping that having flexible lengths will allow more groups to produce this play, and I guess we will see about that! I am curious about how this will work when (or if) I eventually get *THE NIGHT WITCHES* published. Playwriting business adventures!

In even more exciting news, most of the cast will return, AND the incredible Alexandra Harbold has agreed to direct again. I am over the moon excited to jump back in and further develop the script with these artists. AND, for all of those people out there who were unable to get in to the sold out run of *THE NIGHT WITCHES* at the Great Salt Lake Fringe Festival this past summer, opportunity is knocking again!

We'll have five performances between March 27th and 29th. More details and ticket info will come as we get closer, so be sure to check back!
