title: MY BODY To Be Read At SWAN Day in DC March 29th
---

I got some great news yesterday, my ten-minute play about bodily rights, *My Body*, is being read THIS Saturday in Washington DC! It joins the line-up for the [SWAN Day Reading Marathon](http://www.georgetowntheatre.org/current.html) with [Nu Sass Productions](http://www.facebook.com/nusass)! 

All the fun starts at 11:30, this Saturday, March 29th, and it's happening at the National Museum of Women in the Arts! Oh yeah, and it's FREE! Emily Todd, C0-Founder of Nu Sass, is directing, and  Danny Rovin, Alexia Poe, and Emily Todd, will be the actors. Should be a great event!

If you're in the neighborhood, be sure and stop by!
