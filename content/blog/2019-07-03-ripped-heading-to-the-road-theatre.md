Taking a break from the tail end of this epic family road trip to announce the awesome news that *RIPPED* was selected for [The Road Theatre Company](https://roadtheatre.org/)'s [10th Summer Playwrights Festival](https://roadtheatre.org/event/summer-playwrights-festival-10/)! Also, timing has worked out that I will be able to be out there in person in North Hollywood for the reading, and some of the other readings in the festival!

This reading of *RIPPED* will be directed by [Lauren Murphy Yeoman](https://roadtheatre.org/member/yeoman-lauren-murphy/), and is scheduled for Thursday, August 1st at 8pm, at The Road Theatre's Lankershim space. More info about actors and other fun stuff as we get closer, so be sure to check back in!

And that's not all! The festival is packed with 38 plays over 8 days, check out the full-line up on The Road Theatre Company's website [right here](https://roadtheatre.org/event/summer-playwrights-festival-10/)!

Will I see you in LA? Sure hope so!
