![Welcome to Yellowstone image with Elk.](/images/yellowstone.jpg)

Summer vacation is only a few hours away! After a half-day at school my kids will be done and we'll head up to Yellowstone for our first trip of the summer! This will be my first trip up to Yellowstone and I am so excited for some SERIOUS outside adventures. I won't be bringing my computer and I hear there's zero cell service in Yellowstone, so after this afternoon I will not be available to contact until Monday the 11th. SO, if ya need me, feel free to email, but just don't expect a speedy response.

Have a great weekend everyone! Enjoy your adventures!
