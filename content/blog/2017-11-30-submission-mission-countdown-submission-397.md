ALMOST THERE! This morning I sent of submission number 397!!! I submitted *RIPPED* to [Druid Theatre](http://www.druid.ie/get-involved/new-writing/submit-a-script) in Galway, Ireland, they're taking full-length and one-act scripts through *today*. They want original scripts in English, and accept international submissions. On their website I couldn't find a mission with more specifics of the type of plays they're looking for, but looking at their [production history](http://www.druid.ie/productions/previous-productions) gave me some hints. I found this opportunity through the always helpful [NYC Playwrights Blog](https://nycp.blogspot.com/), which I can't recommend enough for finding playwriting opportunities. 

In other news, I made my deadline for a new draft of *MOMMY DANCES WITH THE DEVIL*, thank you very much! It'll be read next month in the [Plan-B Theatre](http://planbtheatre.org/) [Lab](http://planbtheatre.org/the-lab/) and I can't wait! This draft is almost completely rewritten from when I heard the play last August. Plays they are a changin'! And, if you're curious, you can read the newest draft on my [New Play Exchange page here](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/145102/mommy-dances-devil)!

And as usual, if you're reading this through Facebook and missing all my tasty links, click on through to my website.

Happy last day of November everyone!
