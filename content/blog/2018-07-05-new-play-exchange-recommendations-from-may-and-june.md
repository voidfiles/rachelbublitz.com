Even without the [National New Play Network](http://nnpn.org/) challenge, reading plays on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) is a great time. Which is why I didn't stop recommending new plays after April! I'm not putting the same amount of time in-- as I have almost *no* time because of kids and the cruelty/joy of summer vacation-- but I wanted to share the plays that I have read and recommended because I want people to read and then produce these plays! Preferably near me! Okay, here they are....

Plays recommended in May:

[*The Book of Will* by Lauren Gunderson](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/195955/book-will) - one of my *favorite* plays I saw in 2017!

So I had a bit more time in June than May, it seems.

Anyway I hope the list above convinces you how worthwhile it is to get a New Play Exchange membership! And if you already have a membership, be sure to check these plays and playwrights out!

Happy Thursday everyone!
