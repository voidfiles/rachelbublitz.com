title: Submission Tally
---

Since I finished [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/playwrightbinge/info), I thought that I would check in and see how my submissions were going this year.... And see if I'm on track to make my [goals](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2012/12/31/10-resolutions-for-2013/)....

SO, I have gotten 13 people do say yes to submissions I've sent in, I've had 37 people say now, and I'm still waiting to hear back from 86 folks... That brings my total up to 136 submissions this year! 

Thinking about that makes me want a nap... A nap sounds so good right now.
