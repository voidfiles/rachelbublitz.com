Woke up to FANTASTIC news! My full-length [*Let's Fix Andy*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119863/lets-fix-andy) is a finalist for [Playwrights Foundation](http://bayareaplaywrightsfestival.org/)'s Bay Area Playwrights Festival!!!!! I should find out by the end of the month if I make it all the way, but if I'm in I'll be spending a huge chunk of my July at home in the Bay Area! Keep all of your fingers crossed for me!

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!
