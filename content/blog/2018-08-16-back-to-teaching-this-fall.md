Hey hey, starting in just a week and a half I'm going back to that teaching adventure at Weber State University! I'm only teaching one class, but it's also the most fun class that I've taught in my brief teaching stint thus far - Introduction to Acting! I am SO excited to jump back in with a whole new group of people and (hopefully) get them super excited about theater AND less afraid to speak in front of other people. I even got my first email from a student (a very eager student!) so it's on.... Fall Intro to Acting Class here I come! 

Happy Thursday and last few weeks of Summer blog readers!
