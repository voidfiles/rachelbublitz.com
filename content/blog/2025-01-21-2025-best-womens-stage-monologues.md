Super fun publication announcement: I'll have a monologue in [Smith & Kraus'](https://smithandkraus.com/) 2025 Best Women's Stage Monologues, edited by Debbie Lamedman! The monologue, one of Monroe's from [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2017091/funny-like-an-abortion) is a big, messy, charged, and desperate plea to her best friend to make sense of the senseless position Monroe finds herself in.

I'm thrilled to have another monologue in these Best of books! There's a monologue from [*Burst*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/burst) in the [2023 Best Women's Stage Monologues](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Womens-Stage-Monologues-2023/dp/1575259745/ref=sr_1_1?crid=X2ALCEREZJRN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.BGpbsFJeZe3CtukJtz9zN8QhMbxa8UcMRBmlBSn6HWkhG9Dgqb1CZcTJxfcXA5Vv-T8ykTijrFrFj1Wn2w4Gs7sYmZ7E47sKypDqZrWiy8e6espgG1dUa7iL8_Sm2SBKsKH8ckywxit5uKO7Pr_GCeHC3aKVtd1F-hjSFkjlqwzSc-CgaQjm-cs1WWuoTeLQ.RXnklffM9yAleHtAVK9BYwFDfmC8a5ay2KQm0uth6cs&dib_tag=se&keywords=best+2023+women%27s+monologues&qid=1737491684&sprefix=best+2023+women%27s+monologue%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-1), and coming out soon, I have a monologue from [*Let's Fix Andy*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2002467/lets-fix-andy) in the 2024 Best Men's Stage Monologues!

Be sure to check back for when the 2025 women's collection is available, as well as the 2024 men's. I'm very excited for actors around the country to mispronounce my last name in all of those audition rooms.
