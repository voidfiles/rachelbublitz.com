title: 'The Hundred Flowers Project at #BAPF'
---

I had the pleasure to see "The Hundred Flowers Project" by Christopher Chen at [Bay Area Playwrights Festival](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=1). I loved it! And, I learned after that it's getting a full production this October at [Crowded Fire Theater](http://www.crowdedfire.org/), so keep your eyes out for it. If you have a chance next weekend, there will be another staged reading at 6pm on Sunday July 29th.
