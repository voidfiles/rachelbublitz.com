NINE SCRIPTS TO GO!

Submission #391: [Kitchen Dog Theater](http://www.kitchendogtheater.org/) is taking submissions through the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) through November 21st for their [2018 New Works Festival](http://www.kitchendogtheater.org/script-submissions/). They're looking for full length plays with a cast ideally between 1-8 actors, that speaks to their mission:

>"It is the mission of Kitchen Dog Theater to provide a place where questions of justice, morality, and human freedom can be explored. We choose plays that challenge our moral and social consciences, invite our audiences to be provoked, challenged, and amazed. We believe that the theater is a site of individual discovery as well as a force against conventional views of the self and experience. It is not a provider of answers, but an invitation to question. Since theater of this kind is not bound by any tradition, Kitchen Dog Theater is committed to exploring these questions whether they are found in the classics, contemporary works, or new plays."

I tagged *Let's Fix Andy*, my four actor, full-length play about male body-issues. 

One of my *favorite* things about the New Play Exchange, is that they send these opportunities directly to your email. After you've uploaded and tagged your script accordingly, they send notifications every time one of your scripts fits into what a theater is looking for. It's not perfect, sometimes I get notifications that don't really work at all, but more often than not they're right on the money. AND, I'm all for anything that gives me more places to send scripts to, especially with gentle email nudges. If you're not a member of the New Play Exchange, I highly recommend checking it out.
