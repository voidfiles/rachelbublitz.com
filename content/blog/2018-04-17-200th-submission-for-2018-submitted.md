I feel like confetti should be streaming down from my office ceiling as I type this, I suppose I'll have to make do without, because I've just submitted my 200th SCRIPT FOR THE YEAR! Take that #submissionmission! I am waaaaaaay ahead of schedule, if I am able to keep up this crazy pace I just might make it past my goal of 450 and hit *500*! And my leave-no-stone-unturned submission approach this year is paying off already with little hits popping up all over! 

For my 200th submission, I sent a sample of my full-length play [*LET'S FIX ANDY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119863/lets-fix-andy) (currently a finalist for Playwrights Foundation's 2018 Bay Area Playwrights Festival!) to [American Stage](http://americanstage.org/)'s [21st Century Voices: 2019 New Play Festival](http://americanstage.org/play-submissions/)! Here's a bit more about what they're looking for: 

>"This year we are seeking submissions of new plays that promote the exploration of themes relevant to our world today, featuring characters who inspire us."

If you're interested and looking for more details, [visit their submission page](http://americanstage.org/play-submissions/)!

SO! Will I make it 450? Will I blow past 450 and make it all the way to 500? Stay tuned and find out with me as I push myself to crazy playwright limits!
