Welcome to almost Fall! Last month I tried to get back to reading more plays, and for the most part I was successful! I read some terrific new work that I'm very excited to tell you about. I *hope* very much that I can keep it up this month, but I'm not holding out hope. So far September has been completely insane! But that's for another post entirely.... Here are my [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) recommendations for the month of August:

* [*Teenage Dick (vaguely from Richard III)* by Mike Lew](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/57006/teenage-dick-vaguely-richard-iii)  
* [*Far, Far Better Things* by Geetha Reddy](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/411886/far-far-better-things)  
* [*Ghost Play* by Persephone Hudson](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/111816/ghost-play)  
* [*A small breach in protocol at Big Rick's Rockin' Skydive Academy* by Daniel Hirsch](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/449158/small-breach-protocol-big-ricks-rockin-skydive-academy)  
* [*Bombastic Blue* by Olivia Custodio](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450071/bombastic-blue)  
* [*Lucy and the Statue* by Jennifer Kokai](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/318238/lucy-and-statue)  
* [*OPEN* by Crystal Skillman](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/53054/open)  

That's three full-lengths, and four shorts! Crossing my fingers that I can squeeze in a few moments to read this month... But for now, you should check out these plays, almost all are available on the New Play Exchange!

What have you read/seen/heard and loved lately?
