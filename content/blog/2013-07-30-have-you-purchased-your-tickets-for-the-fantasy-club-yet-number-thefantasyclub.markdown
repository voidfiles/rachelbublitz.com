Some people need a lot of reminding... Which is why every day until the show ends (or the runs sells out), I'll be reminding you TO BUY YOUR TICKETS FOR *The Fantasy Club*! Now. Buy them now... Now!

Do that ticket-buying here:

[http://fantasyclub.brownpapertickets.com/](http://fantasyclub.brownpapertickets.com/)

Or here:

[http://www.goldstar.com/events/san-francisco-ca/the-fantasy-club](http://www.goldstar.com/events/san-francisco-ca/the-fantasy-club) 

If you go with Goldstar, there is a limited amount of tickets, so you should *really* get on that.

So you have secured your tickets? Great... Now go tell all of your friends to get tickets too. It's not fair to keep something so good, and so funny to yourself.

I will see you at the show!
