I am over-the-moon excited for my next project with the [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) and now I get to tell you all about it!......... After the success of [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119869/cheerleaders-vs-aliens) I have a *another* commission! For a production in 2019 I'm writing a one-act historical play based on the young women who flew planes for Russia during the Second World War, known as "The Night Witches." 

Since I wrote my first draft of [*ONCE A SPY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/48794/once-spy), another Second World War historical and woman-focused play, I've wanted to write a triptych about women during WW 2, and now I get to start in on play number two in my series! 

My first draft will be due this December, I'll have the Spring for rewrites, and this Summer we'll have a week-long workshop which will jump right into production. My 2019 summer is gonna be *busy*, considering [I already have the World Premiere of *RIPPED* scheduled for July/August in Detroit!](https://rachelbublitz.com/2018/06/20/cast-and-dates-announced-for-ripped-with-outvisible-theatre-company/)! It's cool though, busy is kinda my thing.

I am *especially* excited for this commission for three additional reasons: 

1. I'm going to be pushing the boundaries of what folks think of as Youth Theatre, and the subjects typically tackled, while *still* creating age appropriate roles for young actors to sink their teeth into.
2. I'm planning on *also* writing a full-length version of the script, an idea I can't even fully wrap my head around. It's a fun craft-pushing challenge that I'm really excited to tackle, how do you have both a full-length and a one-act version of the same play? I don't know! Maybe I'll fall flat on my face for this one, but I'm sure gonna try!
3. I not *only* get to research and learn all about kick-butt women most of history has forgotten about or looked over, but I get to tell their story and share it with the world. Which happens to be one of my favorite things.

More info will be coming out over the next year this project; dates, venue (or venues...), director, and SO MUCH ELSE! Be sure to check back in as this project chugs forward!

Happy Monday!
