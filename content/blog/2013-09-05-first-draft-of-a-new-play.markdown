title: First Draft Of A New Play!
---

Nothing like the scent of a brand new play in the air, don't you agree?

I have a first draft of something brand new! It's a 37 page one act that I'm calling (for now that is) *You'll Survive Me*. It's about mothers and daughters, abuse, and the different forms that it comes in. And other things too, probably. I'm very excited to be working on this play all semester with my Directed Writing class. I basically get free dramaturgy all semester long with one of the teachers! Woo! 

More to come as this comes together!
