title: Dawn Of A New Era

Today things have changed. My son who is 2.5 years old started up at preschool. He'll go in the mornings 5 days a week. I will have 4 hours and 45 minutes to myself M-F now. That's 1,995 minutes without kids a week. I worry (very slightly) that without having to chase my kids around I'll have less fire to get work done. Here's to proving myself wrong!

Next month will kick off [The 31 Plays in 31 Days Project](www.31plays31days.com) and if anything can keep me focused, it's that. 

It's kinda funny, I've been thinking a lot about my son starting school for the past few weeks now. I thought he'd cry, or I'd cry, or we'd all cry... But that didn't happen (not yet anyway). I have had a great morning, and that makes me feel slightly guilty. Like I should be biting my nails and counting down the minutes until I pick them up. Being a mother is complicated.
