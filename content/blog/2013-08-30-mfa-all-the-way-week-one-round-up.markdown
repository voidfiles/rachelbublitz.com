title: 'MFA All The Way: Week One Round-Up'
---

First week of grad school is under my belt, woo! I thought it was going to be hard, and so far I have *not* been disappointed. For homework, I have over 150 pages to read by next week, 3 plays to write, 2 poems to translate (one is in a language that I don't speak, and they're POEMS), and the rest of my life to coordinate. 

I've gotten through half of my reading, and started drafts of two of the plays. For this week we're turning in 3 one-minute plays for my Workshop in Short Play class. One could be in the style we feel most comfortable, but the other two should be different. We were told to push the boundaries. So, I've been doing just that. I wrote my first one (only took me THREE hours (I know, on just a one-minute play!)), and it's without a doubt the creepiest play I've ever written. And yes, I will share it with you now! I'll post all of my plays pre-class, and then again after I've gotten feedback on them. So here it is:

###*Peeper*, a one-minute play by Rachel Bublitz

*It is very quiet. TOM is on stage, HE has a pair of binoculars and looks out with them on one specific spot.*
 
####TOM

I like to imagine what her name is.

I have narrowed it down to 84 possibilities, and I am certain that it is one of them. 

Some nights I call them out to her.

Amy?...

I do not yell. I would never yell at her.

Sarah?...

When you watch someone as long as I have watched her you learn things about them. For example, I know that her name cannot be Jackie. I know this. 

Deborah?...

No, not Deborah. That makes for 83. 

83 possibilities. 

Hmmm...

*TOM moves closer to the spot he is watching. TOM’s breathing becomes audible and quick. TOM speaks quickly.*

####TOM (*CONTINUED*)

There goes her blouse.

Tonight the bra she wears is black. 

She did not shave under her arms this morning. 

*Pause. TOM’s speech and breath return to normal.*

####TOM (*CONTINUED*)

Now her light is off.

*TOM lowers his binoculars.*

####TOM (*CONTINUED*)

Sweet dreams. April?...

*End.*

Chilling, right? Check back after next week to see the next draft. OH! And I'll be posting another one of my plays tomorrow, so watch for that as well!
