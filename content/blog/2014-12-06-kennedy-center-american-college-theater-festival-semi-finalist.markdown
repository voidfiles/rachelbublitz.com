title: Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival Semi-Finalist
---

Time for the big/scary news! My ten-minute play MOM'S HAM, finalist last season for Best of [PlayGround](playground-sf.org), is a semi-finalist for [Region 7](http://www.kcactf.org/7/#) of the [Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival](http://www.kcactf.org/KCACTF.ORG_NATIONAL/KCACTF.html)! That means come mid-February, I'll be up in Washington state for a week working on the play with a director and actors, attending workshops and panels at the conference, and finally watching my play presented on the final day of the festival! Being a semi-finalist also means that I could potentially become a finalist and have my work presented at the National Conference in Washington DC come April. 

This is the first time I'll be traveling specifically for my career, and I'm really looking forward to get this first trip under my belt. I sure hope the kids don't mutiny in my absence...

As more info about the festival comes out I'll post it here, and you best believe I'll have all sorts of stories and pictures to share come festival time.

Happy Saturday!
