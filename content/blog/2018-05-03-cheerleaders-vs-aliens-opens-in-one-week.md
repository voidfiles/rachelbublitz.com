And you don't have to just take my word for it that *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS* is going to be an amazing time that you couldn't possibly miss, read these wonderful recommendations it's received on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard):

>"This play excites me so much I might BURST!!! Having worked in high school and middle school theatre education I have long bemoaned the lack of quality scripts for young actors where they get to play characters their own age. Along comes this hilarious, whimsical play with a large cast of mostly females (which rocks since they are the vast majority of members of school theatre programs) to save the day!!! Not only are there a bunch of roles for girls but they are 3 dimensional characters!!! Will be recommending to all my theatre educator friends." -[Shaun Leisher](https://twitter.com/ShaunLeisher), freelance dramaturge, director, producer, and nominator of new works for [The Kilroys](https://thekilroys.org/).

>"You have to love a play where the football players are the victims and the cheerleaders are their saviors. There's a lot of silliness combined with teen-speak, snarky dialogue that perfectly captures the teen spirit. I loved the constant element of surprise that awaited me with every page turn. Bublitz deftly steers away from the jock/mean girl stereotype that often peppers these plays and offers us some real teens: warts and all. The play is a wonderful tin-foil romp through the stars. Teen performers and young audiences will love this." -[Claudia Haas](https://newplayexchange.org/users/948/claudia-haas), widely produced and published playwright who focuses on theatre for young audiences.
