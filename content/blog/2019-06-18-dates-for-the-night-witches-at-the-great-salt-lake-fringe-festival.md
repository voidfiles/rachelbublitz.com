Great news, I have dates for the production of [*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches) in the 2019 [Great Salt Lake Fringe Festival](https://www.facebook.com/greatsaltlakefringe/) later this summer! So go grab a pen and your calendar, you won't want to miss this world premiere, commissioned and produced by the [Egyptian YouTheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre)!

*THE NIGHT WITCHES* by Rachel Bublitz  
directed by Alexandra Harbold

Saturday, August 3, 4:30 PM  
Sunday, August 4, 1:30 PM  
Friday, August 9, 6:00 PM  
Saturday, August 10, 9:00 PM  
Sunday, August 11, 4:30 PM  

Next month we'll have our week long workshop to get the script in shape, then jump immediately into rehearsal! I can't wait to start getting this play on its feet, there's a lot of movement and theatricality, there's even a song! I can't wait to share it with you!

All performances will be at the Gateway, downtown Salt Lake. Check back soon for venue details and keep an eye out for tickets too.

Happy Tuesday!
