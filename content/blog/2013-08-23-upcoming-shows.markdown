So much awesome theater going on in the Bay Area, September is packed with it! Here are the shows that I'm most excited about:

###[Shotgun Players](https://shotgunplayers.org/Online/default.asp)' [BONNIE AND CLYDE](https://www.facebook.com/events/357448044386945/?ref=br_tf), playing now - September 29th

Written by Adam Peck 

Directed by Mark Jackson

>"Over one feverish night in an unnamed southern town, a mythic couple comes to terms with their own mortality. With humor, desperation and tenderness, these icons are made human again, resolving their issues and getting their affairs in order. This potent blend of romance and violence echoes the power of the ancient Greeks. Based on a true story."

I am a sucker for Shotgun Players. They do exciting, beautiful work. Plus Megan Trout is in it, and I think she's always fun to watch.

###[Killing My Lobster](http://www.killingmylobster.com/) and [PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/)'s [THE SHAKESPEARE BUG](https://www.facebook.com/events/1394821104074102/), playing September 6th - 29th

Written by Ken Slattery

Directed by M. Graham Smith

>"Something’s rotten in the city of San Francisco. A modern-day Hamlet is forced to play out the story of his namesake when his eccentric family contracts a mysterious illness on Opening Night. Thrust into a world where actions are amplified to Shakespearean proportions, Hamlet finds himself caught in a revolving door of tragedy and comedy. He is forced to answer the question: If all the world’s a stage, how does he know what role to play?"

###[All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/)'s [BABIES, THE ULTIMATE BIRTH CONTROL; TERRIFYINGLY HILARIOUS PLAYS ABOUT PARENTING](https://www.facebook.com/events/158170084370589/) at the [SF Fringe Festival](http://www.sffringe.org/), playing September 7th (4pm), 14th (9pm), 15th (1pm), and 17th (9pm)

>"Worried your partner is coming down with baby fever? We’ll put a stop to that! Join us for tales from the sleepless side by harried moms Tracy Held Potter and Rachel Bublitz. You’ll gurgle, you’ll cry, and you’ll pee in your pants laughing. Bring your partner for better results."

BY Martin McDonagh

DIRECTED BY John Maio

>"An Irish revolutionary’s fuse is lit by the sudden death of his beloved pet. This brutal and bloody, shocking and horrifying, and ultimately hysterical comedy by bad-boy McDonagh—perhaps today’s most exciting writer—is a commentary on the violence of our world. You’ll hate it. Until you love it!"
