I am SO tired! It was too late last night, while I was driving home from Ogden, that I realized I should have just stayed with a friend in Ogden instead of making the drive back again first thing this morning. Oh well, c'est la vie.

But, on top of being tired, I am also one LUCKY freaking playwright. I have just uploaded a brand new draft of [*FUNNY, LIKE AN ABORTION*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) to the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz). And I am so over-the-moon excited for the developments of the script! Good golly, Miss Molly, this script has come leaps and bounds since the first draft, which I busted out only three weeks ago. And that's what gets me to the lucky! I *just* wrote this play and was able to have THREE readings of it within the three weeks of its first draft. I had time for rewrites in between each, and what was once a mess of ideas has shaped up to be something I am proud to be sending all the places this submission season. I work and write fast, and I've never had the opportunity to develop something so quickly.

So HUGE thank you to the Utah Playwrights Collective and all of its members! HUGE thank you the Plan-B Lab! HUGE thank you to the actors at both of these for taking on my words and these characters. And final HUGE thank you to Alexandra Harbold and her directing class at the University of Utah.

I am one lucky artist.

If you're thinking you just have to read this two-hander comedy about abortion, find it on the [New Play Exchange here](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion)! Or [email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com), and I can get you a pdf.

To artistic communities, and artists supporting and lifting up other artists!
