title: Still A Few Spots Left For The SF Olympians Festival IV Auditions
---

The [San Francisco Olympians Festival IV: Trojan Requiem](http://www.sfolympians.com/) has only a few spots left for their auditions coming up on 9/29 and 9/30. There are 36, yes 36, brand new plays getting staged readings at the Exit this November, and we need your acting talent. My script, *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* has eighteen characters, can you believe that? Even with double casting, it's a bit of a beast, and there are a number of large cast plays too. Actually, there's a really great mix of large and small casts. I know last year it was great to see all the different directions that people took the plays in, and I know that this year will be just as exciting for the same reason!

Here's all the info you need from the [SF Olympians Festival Audition Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/284030435071646/permalink/297192767088746/):

The San Francisco Olympians Festival is returning and will need dozens of actors for its 2013 festival which plays the middle three weeks of November!

In the month of November in 2013, No Nude Men Productions, one of San Francisco’s longest running indy theater troupes, will roll out 36 new plays written by 30 local writers, each one focusing on an element of the Trojan War mythos. 

Each of these 36 plays will receive a dramatic reading at the Exit Theater, and for that we'll need actors, so if you're the kind of person who can act AND read (no, it's not a given), we'd love to have you join us in what promises to be even a bigger success than last year's festival!

Rehearsals will all be in October and November, and will involve 3-5 MAX for each show. The show schedule is as follows, with all shows happening on the mainstage of the Exit Theater, at 8 PM :
