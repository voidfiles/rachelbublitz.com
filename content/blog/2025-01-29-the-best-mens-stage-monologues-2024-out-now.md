Out now and available for purchase, [Smith & Kraus](https://smithandkraus.com/books/p/the-best-mens-stage-monologues-2024)' collection of [The Best Men's Stage Monologues 2024](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Mens-Stage-Monologues-2024/dp/1575259788?crid=1J7SYE2DWVLHT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dp8Q3UNNHYrnYKX0rLlFy5SvF2Fscmnpqq_HQe0khjPGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.2PzluXQhBs3FeU4Km9efBdaUE7MeV28Pxx5PqFkBvKc&dib_tag=se&keywords=smith+%26+kraus+best+monologues+2024&qid=1737571418&sprefix=smith+and+kraus+best+%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-2)! I'm thrilled to have a monologue from my play [*Let's Fix Andy*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2002467/lets-fix-andy) included in the mix! If you're looking for some new audition options, I'd highly recommend picking up a copy. My monologue is joined by a ton of great monologues, from great writers like [Kenneth Jones](https://bykennethjones.com/), [Donna Hoke](https://donnahoke.com/), [Ruben Carbajal](https://rubencarbajal.com/), [Adrienne Dawes](https://www.adriennedawes.com/) and [EM Lewis](https://emlewisplaywright.com/)! With a line-up like that, you really can't go wrong.

Happy reading!
