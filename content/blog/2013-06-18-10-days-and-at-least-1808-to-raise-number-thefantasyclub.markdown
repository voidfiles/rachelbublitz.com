title: '10 Days And At Least $1,808 To Raise #thefantasyclub'
---

It's getting real, guys. With only 10 days to go, we have $1,808 to go, and that's just our *base* goal. We could use some help, so please share our project with your friends! They'll thank you, because everyone loves to laugh! And be sure to tell them soon, because there are only 18 more $50 reward packages! Our most popular reward deal, you get thanked online and in our program, two priority tickets to the show, *and* strawberries and chocolate to enjoy at the show. Did you know that for only $25 more we'll throw in underwear and if we reach our $10,000 stretch goal everyone at that level will get a sexy tweet from Barb herself? Well, now you do!

Big thank you to the wonderful Heather Kellogg for donating yesterday!
