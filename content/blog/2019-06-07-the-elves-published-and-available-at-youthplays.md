I need to make more room on my shelf, because my ten-minute Christmas horror-comedy [*THE ELVES*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/the-elves-by-rachel-bublitz-526) has been published! This will be my third play published with [YouthPLAYS](https://www.youthplays.com/), they also published and license [*CLEVER CATHERINE*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/clever-catherine-by-rachel-bublitz-330), a thirty minute fairy tale play, and [*NO TALKING ALLOWED!*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/no-talking-allowed-by-rachel-bublitz-505), which is available as a stand alone play OR in this groovy anthology: [*It's Elementary! Twelve Short Plays for Upper Elementary School Actors*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/its-elementary-twelve-short-plays-for-upper-elementary-school-actors-512).

I'm so excited to have this strange Christmas play available for young performers. So, if you're on the hunt for a play where Christmas elves conspire to eat children, look no further, *THE ELVES* is just what the doctor ordered! *THE ELVES* was produced at PianoFight's ShortLived contest a few years back, bringing lots of laughter to every audience it had. I hope it continues that trend! Here's more about the play....

>"Sandy and Dennis have the perfect plan: crash the “pre-ride” festivities on Christmas Eve at Santa’s Workshop…and make off with more toys than they can dream of. But Santa’s elves have other ideas. Can Sandy and Dennis escape the clutches of these rhyming terrors, or will the two toy-hungry kids find themselves on the post-ride menu…?"

Convinced you need to own a copy for yourself? I totally understand. You can pick one up for yourself on the YouthPLAYS website by clicking [right here](https://www.youthplays.com/play/the-elves-by-rachel-bublitz-526).

Happy Friday!
