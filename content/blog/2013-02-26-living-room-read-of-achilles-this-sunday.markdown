title: Living Room Read of ACHILLES This Sunday
---

Just got done with my last bit of rewriting of ACHILLES for the living room read this Sunday! I'm excited... Yes I have an obscene amount of people on the stage... Yes it's 136 pages.... And no, I don't have a title for it yet... But this beast will be read, and I need your help to hear it! If you're free, and able to get to Pacifica this Sunday at 6pm (we'll be having a potluck at 6, then reading at 7), *please* [email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com)! 

Now to make many copies of my whale sized script...
