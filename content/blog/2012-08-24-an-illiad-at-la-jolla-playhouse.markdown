title: AN ILLIAD at La Jolla Playhouse
---

Because I am down in San Diego (this week it was one of my sister's, my mom's, and my grandma's birthdays) and because I try and take advantage of all the free theatre I can (my good buddy works at [La Jolla Playhouse](http://www.lajollaplayhouse.org/)) I saw AN ILLIAD last night. It's a one-man show based on Homer's Illiad, and it was excellent. I appreciated how much it was related to modern day warfare without shoving the comparisons into our faces. Also, I was completely floored by both the lighting design and the sound design. [Scott Zielinski](http://scottzielinski.com/) was the brilliant lighting designer, and the original music/sound design was from [Mark Bennett](http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=70035). They also had a cello player, [Brian Ellingsen](http://brianellingsen.instantencore.com/web/home.aspx), and I'm a sucker for the cello. And, [Henry Woronicz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Woronicz) was phenomenal as "Poet." 

There wasn't a whole lot to not like about the show. Check it out if you're in the neighborhood! I come home tomorrow. I'm 90% sure I'll be heading into the city on Monday night for [Theatre Pub's](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/) [MEASURE FOR MEASURE](https://www.facebook.com/events/482508478444046/). Hope to see you there!
