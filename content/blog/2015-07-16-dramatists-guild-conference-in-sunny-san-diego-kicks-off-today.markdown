title: Dramatists Guild Conference In Sunny San Diego Kicks Off Today
---

Loud & Unladylike? Please, that was soooooo last week (and by the way, the final weekend was FANTASTIC, we packed both final readings, and thank you, thank you, thank you for all of those that came out and those that made it happen! We'll be back next year, so stay tuned). 

This week, in my attempt to be too busy for any human to ever be, I'm down in my hometown of San Diego for the [Dramatists Guild Conference](http://www.dramatistsguild.com/nationalconference.aspx), AND IT STARTS TODAY! I'm just finishing up my cinnamon tea, will then be dropping my kids off with Bubby, and racing over to the hotel to register and bask in the glory that is hundreds of playwrights coming together for anything. I'M EXCITED! Can you tell?

I'm going to try and blog about it every night, so be sure to check back. On the agenda today, to give you a taste, will be seminars on: "Writing From History: Finding Your Niche," "Copyright: Can I Do That?" (I can't wait for this one!), "Using the Senses: Character and Story Creation," and many, many more! 

I've got hundreds of business cards ready, and my "Bitches Get Stuff Done" Tina Fey and Amy Poehler shirt on, so really, I'm as prepared as I could ever be. Dramatists, watch out, here I come!
