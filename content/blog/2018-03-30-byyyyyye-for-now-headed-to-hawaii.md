Goodbye for now all my lovely blog readers! I’m off on a family vacation to the Big Island of Hawaii! I’m leaving my computer at home again, which means I won’t be available until Monday April 9th! If you need me, hold that thought and reach out then. Or send it now, with the understanding that I won’t see it until then.

I can’t wait for the warm sand, the warm sun, the warm water, time to read and think, and time to hang with my kiddos and awesome husband.

Catch you later!!
