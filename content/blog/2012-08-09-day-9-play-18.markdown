title: Day 9, Play 18
---

Today I wrote plays 17 and 18. Play 17 was the first play that I thought I'd stick in a drawer and never look at again, *but* it inspired me to write this play, which I think with some fine tuning could be pretty funny. Remember... It's a first draft!

###Ain’t No Party Better Than A Princess Tea Party, a ten minute play

By Rachel Bublitz

*The stage is set for an incredibly elaborate tea party. YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN is on stage. ARIEL, BELLE, and CINDERELLA join her. All four have tea cups.*

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
I can’t believe you’re really here.

CINDERELLA
I never turn down a tea party.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
When I was a kid.... Let’s just say there’s a little girl inside me crying with joy.

BELLE
That’s our main objective, making little girls cry... With joy, of course.

CINDERELLA
Of course with joy.

*Pause.*

ARIEL
The tea is nice. What kind is it?

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Strawberry.

ARIEL
Yum, strawberry.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Anyone need anymore?

CINDERELLA
I’m fine, thank you.

ARIEL
I’m still working on my first cup.

*Pause.*

BELLE
So... Is there a reason why you invited us here today?

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
There’s actually... We’re still waiting on a guest. I invited Snow White.

BELLE
Snow White is coming? Interesting.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Is interesting good?

BELLE
At times.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you didn’t get along.

BELLE
Don’t be silly, I’m a princess. I get along with everyone.

*Pause. SNOW WHITE enters.*

SNOW WHITE
I know I’m late! So sorry!

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
You must be Snow White.

SNOW WHITE
The one and only. Hey girls.

CINDERELLA
Hi!

ARIEL
Hey Snow White.

SNOW WHITE
Hello Belle.

BELLE
Oh, hey Snow White. So nice of you to show up.

SNOW WHITE
Some of us have other social obligations, we can’t be everywhere all the time.

BELLE
I have social obligations.

SNOW WHITE
Sure, sure. (To YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN) Thank you, for having me in your home. I’ll take some tea, if you don’t mind.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Of course!

*YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN pours tea into a tea cup and hands it to SNOW WHITE.*

SNOW WHITE
That’s more like it.

*Pause.*

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Okay, I might as well start. Some of you are probably wondering why I asked you here today. Okay, I’m just going to jump right into it. Well... This is hard for me to say, you guys... You’re my idols....

ARIEL
That is just so sweet.

CINDERELLA
Take all the time you need honey.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
You ruined my life?

CINDERELLA
What? Me?

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
No, all of you. You stupid princesses. You completely ruined my life.

SNOW WHITE
Do you know who you’re talking to?

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Yes. The Disney princesses. The women that taught me that my life would be perfect once I found my one true love. The ones that taught me that no matter how lazy, or rude, or generic this man was, that he would love me and change for me and I would live happily ever after! Well that didn’t happen!

CINDERELLA
Oh dear.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
I met someone. We fell in love... And he completely took advantage of me! He didn’t change or grow into a respectable man, he abused my kindness and left me when I couldn’t help him any longer. And it’s all because of you and your stupid fucking movies!

ARIEL
Please stop swearing, it’s appropriate.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
That’s all you have to say for yourselves? I believed in you! I help you up on pedestals! You taught me the way of the world, or at least that’s what I thought you were teaching me... But that fairy tale world doesn’t exist! It’s a damn lie! (Pointing to ARIEL) You have to give up your family and way of life to be with the man you love. (To SNOW WHITE) You’re hunted like an animal because of your beauty and killed! It’s your beauty, and your beauty alone that saves you when your prince kisses your lips, your beauty is the only thing he cares for! You’re teaching girls that looks are all that matter! (To CINDERELLA) Same thing with you, all your prince cares about if your looks and dance moves, you call that a foundation for a healthy relationship? (To BELLE) And you! You say you want something more, but all you really want it to have a larger house with you beastly prince. All of your stories stop once you meet men. It’s like that’s the important part of your life, the journey it takes to find your husband. What happened before or after makes no difference as long as you get your happy ever after with a guy. What kind of role models are you setting out to be? How are girls supposed to see your stories and not walk away obsessed with wedding and finding a man to change and marry? How? How? Well? Answer me!

ARIEL
Well...

CINDERELLA
It’s...

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Answer me!

BELLE
We don’t owe you a thing.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
How can you say that? Do you know how many years I wasted on that creep because of the sentimental bull shit you brain washed me with?

BELLE
You were a kid! Kids fall in love and get heart broken. With us or without us.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
I wouldn’t have stayed, I would have known better.

BELLE
No you wouldn’t have. It doesn’t matter how much you see examples of relationships, you don’t understand them until you’re in one with a partner who puts in the effort to sustain said relationship. Look, I’m sorry you got hurt, I know how that feels.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Like hell you do.

BELLE
Oh, you know what happened after the Beast was transformed, do you? You’re an expert?

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
You live happily ever after.

BELLE
Do you know how hard it is to sustain a marriage? We’re talking about a long hard, up hill battle. Both people are learning, growing, constantly becoming new people and if you want to stay together you constantly have to adjust and reevaluate or everything crumples around you. We’ve been in couples therapy on four different occasions.

*SNOW WHITE laughs out loud.*

SNOW WHITE
(Fake coughs) Pathetic.

BELLE
Like you can talk! Everyone knows about you and Doc!

SNOW WHITE
Those rumors are ridiculous and disgusting!

CINDERELLA
Oh, give it a rest.

ARIEL
Seriously.

BELLE
Sometimes even two people in open, loving relationships need help. It’s not like everything stands still after your wedding day. You have to work to make it work.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Why didn’t you tell me that?

BELLE
Oh please, you can’t put all of that on us.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Why not?

BELLE
Because there are other things in your life! You weren’t just shoved in a room with a TV, and our movies on rerun were you?

ARIEL
That exists?

BELLE
No it doesn’t exist. (To YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN) Right.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
No, I... But I idolized you. I knew the words to all of your movies. I worshiped you!

BELLE
Then your parents, or parent, or caregiver did you a dis-service. I admit that there are problems with he messages in our movies, I get that... But you can’t blame us for all of your problems. Where were the positive female role models in your life? The real women? 

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
I...

BELLE
Teachers, neighbors, your mom...

SNOW WHITE
If it’s anyone you should be disappointed with, it’s them.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
It is?

BELLE
You’re going to get hurt. You’re going to fall down and make mistakes because this is life and life is messy. You can’t put all of your eggs in one basket, not our basket, or a man’s basket. You need to figure out what drives you, what gets your heart pumping.

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
Well... I like to take pictures.

BELLE
Great. Perfect. Do it. Get out there and do it all the time, eat it, sleep it, breathe it.

CINDERELLA
I run marathons!

ARIEL
I collect antiques!

BELLE
Don’t worry about making money, well don’t worry about making money with taking pictures. Get a job that pays the bills and that gives you the flexibility to do what you love. And if you’re lucky, one day you won’t need that job any more. Forget about boys and men and all of that. You’ll be amazed that once you stop focusing on your love life, things will just click into place it’s own.

SNOW WHITE
True story. I wasn’t looking for love! Hell, technically, I was dead! And boom, out of no where, Prince Charming!

BELLE
And next time... When you meet someone... Don’t be so easy to give them your heart. Take your time. Don’t be so guarded that you never let anyone in, but don’t give your heart away like it isn’t worth anything. Got it?

*Pause.*

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
I guess so. So... I can’t blame you for all of the things screwed up in my life?

BELLE
Nope.

SNOW WHITE
Sorry.

ARIEL
Won’t help anything.

CINDERELLA
Not at all.

BELLE
You’ll be okay. You just have to learn to own your mistakes. Your mistakes are what makes you special, you’ll see. One day, you’ll see.

*Pause.*

SNOW WHITE
Great, now that we’ve got that settled, can we please get to the finger sandwiches? I’m starving!

YOUNG AMERICAN WOMAN
What? Oh yeah... Sure. Coming right up.

*End of play.*
