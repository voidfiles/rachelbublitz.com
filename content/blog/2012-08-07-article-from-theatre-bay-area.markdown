[Trevor Allen](http://www.blackboxtheatre.com/), a guest blogger for Theatre Bay Area, wrote up a post about [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com)! Here are some highlights:

>"Although the concept isn’t entirely new, it is an excitingly fresh take on new play creation. It’s as if someone took the National Novel Writing Month model and Suzan-Lori Parks’ 365 Days/365 Plays concept, threw in a couple of 24-hour, 10-minute and one-page festivals and did a mash up. The result would probably look something like this, only not as well organized." From "So, You’re Going to Write 31 Plays in 31 Days? Really?" by Trevor Allen

And...

>"According to Bublitz, it’s meant to “generate new work” as well as “build a community of writers, who normally write in isolation.” She says that it’s important to push yourself as a writer and her message to anyone curious about it is to join in and “find out if you’re playwright enough.” Potter adds that “the purpose of 31P/31D is to challenge writers to go beyond whatever boundaries or obstacles they’ve been encountering.”" From "So, You’re Going to Write 31 Plays in 31 Days?
