title: Why Submitting Is The Best
---

You should start, if you don't already, submitting your work as many places as possible. Out of the 30 plays I submitted during this past binge in September, I've had *2* productions! Now, 2 out of 30 might not look like the best odds, but I am really happy by those numbers. Also, the more people who see and know about your work, the more people who know about you! I got an email on Saturday requesting work! Someone really enjoyed *Ghost Story* at [Love Creek Production](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Love-Creek-Productions/58978756369?fref=ts) and wanted to know if I would consider submitting to their theatre. No company is too small. Submit everywhere it's appropriate... You can just never tell where it will lead!

That's all for now. Hope your weekend was as rad as mine!
