title: So Pumped For Women In Solodarity
---

Earlier today we had auditions for [All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/)'s upcoming showcase Women In Solodarity: Cat Ladies. And while I'm not ready to announce the cast, I will announce to the world how happy I am with auditions! We had some powerhouse performers come in and it's sad that we had to say no to anyone. The other great part of this morning was that for the first time I got to hear these fresh new pieces out loud, and let me tell you, the writing this year is excellent... And I'm not just saying that because I wrote one of the monologues... I guarantee that you will not want to miss this show. 

Stay tuned because we'll be announcing the full cast list as well as the writers involved very soon!
