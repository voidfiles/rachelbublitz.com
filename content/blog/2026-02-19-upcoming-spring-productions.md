Spring is almost here! Though here in Salt Lake it feels like winter just started, we got some much needed snow yesterday. I'm thrilled to have my work going up all around the country and in Canada, and for the first time, in South Africa! Plays around the world!

As you can see the collection [*Rogues' Gallery*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/rogues-gallery), which includes my ten-minute play [*Midnight Bandits*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/midnight-bandits), is especially popular. Last year this collection (with [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/)) was one of the most produced, making the [Top 10 Full-Length Plays 2025](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/blog/post/top-10-full-length-plays-of-2025) list, and I'm thrilled to see those productions are not slowing down!

Here's the full list of productions and where they're happening:

My Olympic watching is continuing, just watched the USA Women's Hockey Team win GOLD! Let's go, ladies!

Happy Thursday!
