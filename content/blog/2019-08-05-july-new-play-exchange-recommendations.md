This summer is keeping me busy, but thankfully last month I was able to carve out a bit of reading time. I was particularly struck by the three new plays I read and recommended on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard)...

### July Reads  
* [*Door to Balloon* by Greg Romero](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/116321/door-balloon)  
* [*CREAM!* by John J. Caswell, Jr.](https://newplayexchange.org/users/10848/john-j-caswell-jr) - which I am SO excited to hear is getting produced in Phoenix!  
* [*Frank Talk* by Sharon Goldner](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/94390/frank-talk)  

Please read these plays and produce these plays! Each is tackling theatre in very exciting ways.

What have you read or seen and fallen in love with lately?
