It is *such* a small world! Especially when your play is about to be done on the other side of the country, and the director reaches out to chat about the script, you see her phone number also has a San Diego area code, and you find out that she went to the next high school over from yours, and graduated a year behind you. That's what happened to me yesterday, as the director for the upcoming reading of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) at [Bristol Valley Theatre](http://bvtnaples.org/) (waaaay over in Naples, NY) and I chatted. And now we're also planning to get coffee when I'm down in San Diego next month, and she really likes my play, and she sounds so smart and great, and we'll (probably) become best friends forever, and now we'll have a super meet/cute story to go with our soon-to-be friendship..... I swear I'm not a weirdo.

ANYway, I also have a date for the reading of *RIPPED*, which is next up in Bristol Valley Theatre's [New Works Initiative](http://bvtnaples.org/bvt-new-works-initiative/)! And I can share my awesome director's name!.....

*RIPPED*, directed by Kate Reynolds (yay!), will have a one-time reading July 17th (that's a week from tomorrow!) at 7pm, tickets are $5 at the door. If you're in the area, please go see the reading and tell me all about it. If you're not, it's getting close so figuring out your transportation should be your top priority now.

AND, since there's are readings of *RIPPED* July 13th and 14th (this Friday and Saturday!) in North Hollywood with [Nasty Theatre Company](https://www.nastytheatrecompany.com/), you should consider an epic *RIPPED* coast-to-coast road trip. I'd see the reading on the 13th, if that's the case, you want to give yourself as much time to get over to New York as possible.

Happy Monday and safe driving! Remember to use those turn signals!
