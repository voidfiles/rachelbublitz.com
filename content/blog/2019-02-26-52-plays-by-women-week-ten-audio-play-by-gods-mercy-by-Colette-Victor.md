This week for [52 Weeks By Women](https://twitter.com/52playsbywomen) I listened to an audio play! Another participant in the 52 Plays by Women challenge who I follow on twitter, [Hanna Ã…kerfelt](https://twitter.com/HannaHeartfelt), tweeted about a play available on [BBC World Drama](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0043kb2) as one of the 2018 International Playwriting Competition winners. So today on my long commute I listened to South African writer Colette Victor's radio play [*BY GOD'S MERCY*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csy5bb). The recording will be available for the next six days, so if you're interested give it a listen. Runs a bit over fifty minutes.

I'm really digging all the different ways to come at this challenge. This weekend I'm hoping to catch a live production of a play, it'll all come down to ticket availability, so keep your fingers crossed for me!

What did you see/read/listen to this week?
