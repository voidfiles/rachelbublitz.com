title: Mix Tapes Volume One Extended! Now Running 9/13, 9/14, 9/20, and 9/21!
---

[San Jose Rep](http://www.sjrep.com/)'s Emerging Artist Lab or [SJReal](http://www.sjrep.com/experience/real/) for short, loves the [Mix Tape Volume One] show *so* much, they're giving up another weekend! That means that you have four possible times to see the show. We're also expanding the songs, so that they aren't all just from Janis Joplin. Come and see new translations of some great songs!

To remind you how *amazing* this show will be, let me remind of the other writers involved: [Peter Hsieh](http://peter-hsieh.com/Home_Page.html), Amber Sommerfeld, [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/), and [Jeremy Cole](http://jeremycole.org/)! Peter Hsieh will be directing, and we have Morgan Voellger, James Allan, James Der, Emily Brouwer, Stephanie Whigham, and Lee Robin Salazar as our acting talent. Woo! 

The show now runs 9/13, 9/14, 9/20, and 9/21, and it'll start after the main show is over, roughly 10:15pm. This is a very exciting project, and you will not want to miss it.

Hope to see you there!
