This Friday, November 1st, join the [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) at [The Exit](http://www.theexit.org/) in San Francisco for the opening night party! And then come back November 6th - 23rd and watch staged readings of 36 brand new plays all written by local playwrights. It will be a festival filled with fantastic new theatre and you DO NOT WANT TO MISS IT!

My play, *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* is based on the legend of Achilles, and it will be NOVEMBER 9th! It is a beast of a play and I cannot wait to share it with everyone. Please join me on November 9th, remember to bring cash ($10) and come early to get good seats!

I will also be watching a TON of the other plays (I've been hearing bits and pieces of them all year and I know there are some fantastic pieces being presented!). So I hope to see you a LOT in November! 

Here's the facebook event for *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats*:
