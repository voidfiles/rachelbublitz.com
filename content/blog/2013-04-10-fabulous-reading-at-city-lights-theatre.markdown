title: Fabulous Reading At City Lights Theatre
---

Last night was a blast. *Horny Like The Wolf*, one of my ten minute plays, joined 7 other short plays for [City Lights Theatre](http://cltc.org/footer-opportunities/new-play-series/) spring short reading series. There's a moment in a lot of my plays before they jump into the insane or vulgar, and my stomach usually lurches and I wonder... Will the audience come with me on this ride? Last night they jumped right on the bus and laughed their butts off. That is a great feeling, by the way, putting laughter into the world.... 

My cast hit every joke, and I love them for that. Big thank you to [Martha Rynberg](http://www.martharynberg.com/directing.html), Matt Gunnison, and [Catz Forsman](http://www.catzforsman.com/). And another giant thank you to my good friend, an incredibly gifted director, [Tracy Held Potter](https://www.facebook.com/TracyHeldPotter?fref=ts).

Want to join in the fun? Well, you can! [City Lights Theatre](http://cltc.org/footer-opportunities/new-play-series/) takes not yet produced scripts and considers them for their season as well as their reading series. They're looking for full length plays, one acts, and short plays. It's a snap, fill out their application (found on the website), and submit that along with the script and your resume. Boom.
