title: Six Hours Until THE FANTASY CLUB
---

We are very close to sold out for tonight's performance of *The Fantasy Club*! And after tonight you'll only have two more chances before it's gone, gone, gone! Saturday we still have seats, an Sunday is looking similar to Friday. But we hope to get everyone in! Buy your tickets in advance to guarantee your seat!

I wish I could say that I was taking a break after *The Fantasy Club* comes down, but I'm not stopping for nothing! I am only 7 plays in to [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/), I have a full length play to finish (I'm 22 pages into my first draft), my proposals for the [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) to write, grad school starting, *kindergarten* starting (for my girl), and a theater in Belfast just wrote to tell me they want to help me develop another play that I've been working on (more details to come as things are worked out). Sleeping is overrated. 

Buy your tickets for *The Fantasy Club* before you miss the whole thing!
