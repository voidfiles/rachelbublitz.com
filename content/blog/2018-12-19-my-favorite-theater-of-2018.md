2018 is coming to an end and so what better time to look back and reflect on my
favorite theater of the year! I saw a ton of amazing stuff, including a lot of
world premieres (including one of my own!), some great touring shows, and my
first shows on Broadway. I loved a lot of what I caught, but these five reached
me in a profound way.

SO! My favorite shows (excluding things I wrote, of course!)....

5. THE WOLVES by Sarah DeLappe, directed by Alexandra Harbold, at [Salt Lake 
Acting Company](https://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/).

4. OSLO by J.T. Rogers, directed by Karen Azenberg, at [Pioneer Theatre Company](https://www.pioneertheatre.org/)

3. THE NEW ONE by Mike Birbiglia, directed by Seth Barrish, at [Cort Theatre](http://shubert.nyc/)

2. THE FERRYMAN by Jez Butterworth, directed by Sam Mendes, at [Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre](http://bernardjacobstheater.tickets/)

And the show that grabbed me the most, possibly of my whole life:

1. FAIRVIEW by Jackie Sibblies Drury, directed by Sarah Benson, at [Berkeley Rep](http://www.berkeleyrep.org/index.asp)

Three cheers for great theater, and three more for even more great theater in
2019!!

Happy Wednesday, and catch up with everyone in 2019!
