title: 'Gotten Tickets For THE FANTASY CLUB Yet? #thefantasyclub'
---

It's July 15th! Do you know what that means? Only 18 days until opening night of *The Fantasy Club*! That's right, opening night is August 2nd! So, now that you know the show is almost upon us, here is my next question... *Have you bought your tickets yet?* Because friends, this is NOT a show that you want to miss. Tickets are $18.50 ($15 for students/seniors), and there are only SIX performances of the show. So no more waiting, buy your tickets now!

[Click here to buy tickets on brownpapertickets.com](http://fantasyclub.brownpapertickets.com/)!!

And if you'd like to RSVP, so all your friends on facebook know how rad you are, [do that here on *The Fantasy Club* event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/117656981778454/).

If you're ready via facebook, here are the links for you in case you missed them...
