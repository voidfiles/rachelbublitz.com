I sent out FIVE scripts this afternoons which means that I have OFFICIALLY COMPLETED MY 2017 SUBMISSION MISSION! WOO!

A friend of mine was requesting plays on facebook for the university she works for, and she wanted scripts with a majority female and multi-racial cast. I sent *MOMMY DANCES WITH THE DEVIL*, *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*, and *ONCE A SPY* her way. BUT what's also super cool is that when I told her about the plays on her post, an artistic director reached out to me because he was *also* interested in reading *MOMMY DANCES WITH THE DEVIL* and *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*! Adding those five submissions to my total for the year, and I'm over by 2! 402 plays submitted SO far this year, and I don't plan to slow down this month. To see how much I get past my goal, you'll have to check back after the first of the year.

Now to get my sixth and final full-length play written for the year and then I'll have hit both of my crazy goals of the year! Almost time to figure out some crazy ideas for 2018...
