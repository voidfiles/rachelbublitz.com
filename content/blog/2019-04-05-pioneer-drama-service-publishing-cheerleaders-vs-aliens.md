I HAVE FANTASTIC NEWS TO SHARE!

[Pioneer Drama Service](https://www.pioneerdrama.com/) is publishing [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119869/cheerleaders-vs-aliens)!!!

This is incredible turn around, I'd only sent the play out to publishers two months ago in February, and I'd expected to wait at least six months, but I was wrong! And I've never been so excited to be wrong!

*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS* was commissioned and received its World Premiere with the [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) in Park City, Utah. HUGE thank you to Jamie Wilcox, the artistic director of the Egyptian Youtheatre for meeting me for coffee in the first place, and then for saying yes to my crazy idea. Thank you to Alicia Washington for directing the play through development and onto its first production!

YOU WILL SOON BE ABLE TO PURCHASE MY PLAY AND HOLD IT IN YOUR HANDS IN BOOK FORM! Eeeeeeeeeeee!!

While this isn't my first published play, it is my first published *full-length play*. I'm thrilled to think of the high school across the country (AND the world, because Pioneer Drama Service is global!) that will now have the opportunity to find this play. I wrote *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS* because it was the type of play I wish I'd had the opportunity to be in when I was in high school. I hope the students who step into this wacky world I created enjoy it as much as I do.

Updates on when and where to purchase the play will be coming, so pay close attention!

Oh! And it's my *BIRTHDAY* today! What a perfect present, Universe, thank you!!

Happy Friday!
