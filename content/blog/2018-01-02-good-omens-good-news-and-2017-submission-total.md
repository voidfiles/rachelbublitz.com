+++

I'm starting out this New Year with a good sign, I received an email (my *first* email of the New Year, in fact!) that requested I send a theater a full draft of *Ripped*! I'm taking it as a good sign for 2018. And I closed the 2017 year strong with some exciting news: [*Ripped* is a 2018 Detroit New Works Festival Semifinalist](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/newworks/)! I should find out by the end of this month if I'll be moving forward and heading out to Detroit later this year, keep your fingers crossed for me!

And finally, my submission total for 2017. I had a goal to send out 400 scripts, and I kicked that goal's butt by sending out 416 scripts last year! That's the biggest submission total in a year I've ever had. And I think I like the sound of that trend... This week I'll be mulling over my goals for the year, so if you're curious about my wild and crazy plans for 2018, be sure to check back.

Happy 2018 everyone!
