On my submission mission to submit more plays this calendar year than I've ever done before (previous best year was way back in 2014 with 366 submissions) and so far I'm on track to get it done! For the month of July I sent 35 submissions out into the world, which brings my 2017 total up to 238! And with 153 days left in this year, if I can stick to my minimum of one play per day I'm on track to submit 391 times this year! Woo! And hell, since that's an uneven number, and since I like to challenge myself, let's just say 400. Yep, that's my number for the year, my goal, my submission mission. 

Time to get it done!
