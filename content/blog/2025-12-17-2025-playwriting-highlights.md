![Playwriting highlights for 2025](/images/playwriting2025.jpg)

The year is coming to an end, and I'm about to leave for my holiday travels... but, before I go, let's look back at the awesome year 2025 was!

Top left: Yes! I wrote a book! [How to Build a Playwright in Three Acts](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/how-to-build-a-playwright-in-three-acts#tab-1) is published through Stage Partners, and is there to help you finish a play! If you haven't picked up a copy yet, better get on it!

Middle middle: I was interviewed by [Brian James Polak](https://www.brianjamespolak.com/) for [American Theatre Magazine](https://www.americantheatre.org/)'s [The Subtext](https://www.americantheatre.org/category/audio/the-subtext/)! [If you missed it, you can still isten here](https://www.americantheatre.org/2025/05/06/the-subtext-rachel-bublitz-is-writing-for-her-younger-self/), or on [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-subtext/id1336692606) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2HToPqMuDIgK8pgqBpi5vO).

Middle right: [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/funnylikeanabortion) was published through Original Works Publishing! This two-hander comedy received a National New Play Network Rolling World Premiere, and I'm so pleased it found its forever home with Original Works Publishing.

Bottom left: I was honored to be a special guest at [Alchemy Theatre](https://www.alchemytheatretroupe.org/)'s New Works Festival, where I read and responded to plays and gave multiple talks. It was amazing to not only visit a part of the country I'd never been to, West Virginia, but also to connect with so many theater artists! Alchemy Theatre had produced my plays [*Cheerleaders VS. Aliens*](https://www.pioneerdrama.com/SearchDetail.asp?PC=CHEERLEADE) and [*The Book Women*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/the-book-women) in previous seasons.

Bottom middle: My other published play for the year: [The Hardy Girls](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/hardy-girls), commissioned and published with Stage Partners! This play was a hoot and a half to write, and has already booked two productions since it was published! Click the title if you'd like to read it for yourself!

Bottom right: In a year very full with writing a book, working on [*Hear Us Roar*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/3193750/hear-us-roar) was a welcome break back into writing the way I knew how. Developing this play at the University of Utah, which was also commissioned by them, was a total joy this year. I learned a *ton* and finally got to see how this play would make sense in production. [Read more about the developmental production here](https://rachelbublitz.com/2025/12/12/hear-us-roars-developmental-production-at-the-university-of-utah/), and be sure to check back in the new year when the brand new draft is available!

What a year! I'm excited to see what 2026 has in store!

Happy Holidays and New Year! See ya in 2026!
