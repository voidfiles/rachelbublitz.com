Oh hey! I have two new monologues available on [MonologueBank](https://www.monologuebank.com/)! All those actors out there looking for new audition material, or teachers looking for monologues for their students to work on, check it out! One of the monologues is from the about to be published play [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://www.monologuebank.com/cheerleaders-vs-aliens-welcoming-committee-gilda.html) (available soon from [Pioneer Drama Service](https://www.pioneerdrama.com/Default.asp?src=top)!), the other is from [*LET'S FIX ANDY*](https://www.monologuebank.com/let-s-fix-andy-fat-andy.html).

If you're curious how MonologueBank works, or want to give it a try, use my discount code, [BUBLITZ50](https://www.monologuebank.com/rachel-bublitz.html) for half-off any purchase you make of my work (good for two purchases). MonologueBank is a super groovy model for getting writers PAID for their work, so don't be shy! Give it a spin today. Lots and lots of great material throughout their site.

Happy Monday, and three cheers for writers making money for their craft!
