title: 18 Days Until UNDER THE GODS' GOLDEN CLEATS
---

Guys. GUYS! There are only 18 days until a theater full of people get to watched the staged reading of *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats*! I am beyond pumped for this reading, and I do hope that you make it out!... And get there early with cash, because there are NO advance tickets! Cash at the door, and with being such a big cast, AND with it being so awesome I am pretty sure the house will be packed. So, come for the reading AND come early!

As an added incentive to get you to the theater, remember that you could win your very own Achilles jersey! There will be a raffle after the show, and you, (yes you!) could be the big winner. So mark your calendar, and set your cash aside!

Here's the link for the facebook event page:

RSVP! And invite all your buddies too.

See you soon!
