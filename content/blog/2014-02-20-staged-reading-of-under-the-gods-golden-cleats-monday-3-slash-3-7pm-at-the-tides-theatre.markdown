title: Staged Reading Of UNDER THE GODS' GOLDEN CLEATS Monday 3/3 7pm at The Tides
  Theatre
---

Have you heard the great news? *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* is coming back to the stage! Through the [Dramatist Guild](http://www.dramatistsguild.com/)'s San Francisco Footlight Reading Series, you have another chance to see the greatest football tournament of all time; Greeks vs. Trojans. 

Here are all the things you need to know:

UNDER THE GODS' GOLDEN CLEATS by Rachel Bublitz

Directed by Claire Rice 

Cast TBA (stay tuned!)

>"UNDER THE GODS' GOLDEN CLEATS mashes up Achillesâ€™ story in the Trojan War with the football culture of modern day Texas, creating a brand new world where cheerleaders are property, and the Gods preside over the games. Achilles, a young football legend, is the number one ranked player in the country. When the Trojans kidnap their precious bovine mascot, Helen, Achilles chooses to die young and glorious rather than grow old and lose his talents."

Monday March 3rd

Doors open at 6:45pm, reading beings promptly at 7:00pm
