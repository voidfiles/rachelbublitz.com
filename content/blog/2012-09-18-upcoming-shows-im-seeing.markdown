title: Upcoming Shows I'm Seeing
---

There is so much exciting theatre going on right now, I'm bummed that I'm missing so much of it. If only my kids would hurry up and be old enough to either leave home or bring with me (yes I know I will wish them to little again when they *are* old enough for that). But I am pretty lucky to be able to see what I am seeing. What am I planning on seeing? I'm so glad that you asked....

##[FRUSTRATION, a benefit show for Play Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/events/107174879434284/)

It's this Sunday at 3pm, it's FREE, and it's in Berkeley.

Yes I have a piece in the show and I'm directing one of the plays, but I'd be going to this anyway. Play Cafe does a lot to help out local playwrights, and I'm excited to see the work that will be showcased. The second scene from my one act play TERRIBLE PEOPLE will close the show, I hope to see you there! 

Oh, and they will be accepting donations, should you be moved to give!

##[THE PLAY ABOUT THE BABY at The Custom Made Theatre](http://www.custommade.org/)

The show has started it's run, and it's playing through October 7th. I'm seeing the show on September 27th if you feel like following me around.

[Edward Albee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Albee) is my very favorite playwright of all times, so I try and make it a habit to see anything of his that's done in the area. And so far this show has gotten rave review after rave review. You'll regret not seeing it!

##[MY SISTER'S BABY a developmental reading presented by Playwright's Center of San Francisco](https://www.facebook.com/events/420239358038714/)

Oct. 1 (Monday) at 7:30pm. $10 donation, free for members.

Surprise, surprise... I will in fact be attending the developmental reading of my full length play MY SISTER'S BABY. I have a stellar cast, and I've been working hard on the draft that will be presented that night. Come, show your support, and give me some feedback!

##[SPOOKY CABARET from Wily West Productions](http://wilywestproductions.com/)

A four night festival that runs October 7th-10th featuring spooky plays from local writers! Get your halloween on early! 

##[BOUND BY BLOOD from Ianiro Productions](https://www.facebook.com/events/430250107011668/)

The show runs October 5th - 27th at 8pm at Boxcar Playhouse ([505 Natoma Street, San Francisco, CA](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=505+Natoma+Street,+San+Francisco,+CA&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x80858083f033d9db:0x9e1cbba166a0f15a,505+Natoma+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94103&gl=us&ei=PzRZUIDgOOLMiQKXmoCYCA&ved=0CCEQ8gEwAA))

And, of course....

Got all that? Okay, now go out and see some theatre!
