I am an official, card carrying member of the [Dramatists Guild of America](http://www.dramatistsguild.com/)! I actually have a card and everything, it came along with some other materials in the mail today. What other materials you ask? Well, I'd love to tell you...

1. Bill of Rights, not from the constitution... But still impressive.
2. The Dramatists Guild Resource Directory, 2012.
3. My previously mentioned member card.
4. And last, but not least, *The Dramatist*, The Journal of the Dramatists Guild of America, Inc. THE SWIMSUIT ISSUE! I am being 100% serious. I laughed for, wait... I'm still laughing! It's a *SWIMSUIT ISSUE* of a PLAYWRIGHT magazine! Yes, it's supposed to be ironic. Totally worth becoming a member for this moment alone.
