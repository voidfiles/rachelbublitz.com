title: Zombies At Theatre Pub and Submission Update
---

The awesome folks over at [Theatre Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/) are bringing us [Love in the Time of Zombies](https://www.facebook.com/events/469989143022513/) by local playwright [Kirk Shimano](http://www.kirkshimano.com/KirkShimano/Home.html). I'm excited, are you excited? Here are all the gritty details:

October 15, 16, 22, 29, 30, 2012

Cafe Royale, 800 Post St. San Francisco, CA 94109

7pm: Pop-up Kitchen (Mon: BBQ, Tues: Sushi) (YES, not only do you get to see awesome theatre, you get awesome food! The pop-up bbq I had last time was killer!)

8pm: Performance

Cost: Free, $5 Suggested Donation

[Claire Rice](http://claireannrice.blogspot.com/p/resume.html) is directing. This is going to be a show that you will not want to miss. Be there, and get to Cafe Royale early, it tends to fill up.

Oh! And I submitted play #27 to [The City Theatre](http://citytheatre.com/pages/). I sent them NAP TIME. They are looking for 10 minute scripts, you can email them and the deadline is October 31st.

Play #28 (GARBAGE DISPOSAL, one of my 31 plays from August, first time submitting it!) was sent over to [Lakeshore Player's](http://www.lakeshoreplayers.com/index.html). They are also looking for 10 minute plays, with little offensive language (I had a hard time finding a play to submit!). You can email your scripts, but they want a blind copy and a not blind copy. The deadline is November 1st.

2 down, 2 to go!
