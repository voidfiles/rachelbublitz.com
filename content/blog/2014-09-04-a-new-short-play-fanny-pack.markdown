title: 'A New Short Play: FANNY PACK'
---

I'm taking a short play workshop class with [Peter Nachtrieb](http://www.peternachtrieb.com/)! Our first assignment was to write three 1 - 3 minute plays. This was my favorite of the three. But now I want to write nothing but plays for these two characters. Probably not the best career move, but they're basically the best. Keep reading and you'll see why...

###*Fanny Pack* a short play by Rachel Bublitz

*FURIA and PERDITA - both extremely ugly and old females - lounge in chairs around a table, blood covering their faces and dribbling down their front. The table itself is covered in blood and bits of guts/bones. A fanny pack sits in the center of the table, on the floor around them are other pieces of clothing.*

PERDITA
We ought to think about cooking one. Might be a nice change.

FURIA
That’d take forever.

PERDITA
Not if we cut ‘em up all tiny-like... Add some salt and spice.

FURIA
I like ‘em kickin’. Otherwise what’s the point? Otherwise we might as well be havin’ a stinkin’ burger.

PERDITA
Yeah... That’s right.... I’m just good and thick, that’s all I am....

FURIA
... Hey, cheer up no Perdy! (*Taking the fanny pack off the table and strapping it on HER head*) Lookie-here, lookie-at-me, with my fancy bag, just walking ‘round like I was King o’ Everything!

*PERDITA laughs.*

PERDITA
Me next!

*FURIA tosses the fanny pack to PERDITA, SHE puts it on.*

PERDITA (CONTINUED)
Oh yeah - and lookie-lookie I don’t think no one’s gonna eat me!

*FURIA and PERDITA erupt with laughter. It takes THEM a while to recover.*

FURIA
Oh now.... That’s good... Oh yeah.

*Perdita throws the fanny pack across the room.*

PERDITA
All this laughin’s got me hungry again!

FURIA
I’d go for another.

PERDITA
Thinkin’ mallet or ax?

FURIA
Oh, the mallet. Yes. Makes the meat so nice ‘n tender.

*End of play.*
