title: The San Francisco Olympian Festival Unveils THE TROJAN REQUIEM Poster
---

![THE TROJAN REQUIEM by Cody Rishell](/images/trojanposter.jpg)

This amazing poster comes from the art director of the [San Francisco Olympian Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/), [Cody Rishell](http://www.codyrishell.com/). The festival kicks of November 5th, and this poster makes me think November can't come soon enough!

*Under The Gods' Golden Cleats*, my full length play about Achilles will have a reading on November 9th, but keep in mind that there are THREE weeks of plays, and you should keep your schedule clear so you can make it to as many as possible. No big deal, just keep all of November free. I mean, look at that poster, I don't think with an image like that you can afford to miss any of it!
