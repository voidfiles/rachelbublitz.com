title: Opportunities With SF Theatre Pub
---

[SF Theatre Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/we-have-a-new-mission-statement-and-new-opportunities/) is currently accepting proposals for their 2013 season. From their website:

>"So- got an idea for a one night show that works in a bar-space like ours and you think fits in with the new mission statement (and the kind of crowd we tend to attract)? Let us know! We’ll be accepting project ideas for the following dates, all the way up till January 1st!

>February 18, April 15, May 20, June 17, August 19, November 18

>Additionally, we are looking for a larger project for October, to play October 15, 21, 22, 28 and 29. Halloween themed preferred, but not limited to. This production could potentially be fully staged, though once again, within the limitations of the bar (i.e. we don’t do much in way of standing scenery, full orchestras, or lots of light and sound).

>Be sure to include as much info as you can- about you, anyone you want to bring in with you (actors, musicians, etc.), how you see this idea working in the bar and what your plan is to get thing thing on its feet with a budget of zero. Remember this is indie theater as trench warfare- innovative and passionate wins the day!

>Send proposals to [theaterpub@atmostheatre.com](mailto:theaterpub@atmostheatre.com)

>Looking forward to hearing your ideas!"

Get all that? Things to know... Deadline is January 1st, 2013... And they're looking for both original work as well as re-imagined classics. While I have not worked directly with SF Theatre Pub yet, I've been to several of their shows... Let me tell you, they're always a blast. Not sure what I'll propose yet, but I'm planning on submitting something. You should too! Get on it.
