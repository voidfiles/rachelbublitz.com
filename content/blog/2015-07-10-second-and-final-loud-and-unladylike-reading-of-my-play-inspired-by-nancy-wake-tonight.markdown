title: Second And Final Loud And Unladylike Reading Of My Play Inspired By Nancy Wake
  TONIGHT
---

Tonight friends is the second and FINAL reading of my play inspired by Nancy Wake in [DIVAfest](http://divafest.info/)'s [Loud & Unladylike Festival](http://loudandunladylike.com/)! Weird that I'm not saying the title, right? Well, that's cause I CHANGED IT! See folks, this festival is all about development, and sometimes that means a new title.

Curious about what the new title is? COME AND SEE TONIGHT!

We'll announce it on stage and after the play you can tell me how much you love/hate it. It'll be great!

But really, tonight, 8pm, at [EXIT Theatre](http://www.theexit.org/). Be there folks! DO IT!
