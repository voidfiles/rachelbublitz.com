title: MFA Application In
---

I had a crazy weekend. We're looking for a new place to live (which is super stressful), and one of my kids was sick (aren't they always?), AND the SFSU MFA deadline was looming over me like a ticking time bomb.... But guess what? Not anymore. Yes sir, I got in all my junk today! And, 11 days before the deadline... Now I can go back to worrying about finding shelter for my kids.
