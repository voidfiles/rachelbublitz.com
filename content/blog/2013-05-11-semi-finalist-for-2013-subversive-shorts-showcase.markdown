title: Semi Finalist For 2013 sUBVERSIVE sHORTS Showcase
---

I was notified this morning that my short play about woman's reproductive rights, *My Body*, is a semi-finalist for the 2013 [sUBVERSIVE sHORTS](http://www.subversivetheatre.org/) Showcase! They are handing over the top scripts to the prospective directors, and the directors will have the final say. I feel pretty great it's gotten this far! Stay tuned to see if *My Body* gets into the showcase!
