title: One Year Anniversary
---

Not sure of the exact date, but we're close enough so I'm calling it. Happy anniversary to me! I've been writing plays for a year now! Not a bad year, here's what I've done:

I've written....

2 full length plays
2 one act plays
9 10 minute plays

I've had...

1 play published (Bill and Kelly)
1 play produced (Her Special Day)
1 play read in a staged reading series (The Fantasy Club)
And 1 play going to be read in a staged reading series (Abomination)

And, my submission count in my first year...

134 total submission!

Not bad, not bad at all. I can't wait to see what I do in year 2! Stay tuned.
