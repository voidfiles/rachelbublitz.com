#RACHEL'S GUIDE TO SUMMER THEATER AWESOMENESS PART DEUX

##JUNE

###City Lights Theater Company presents EXIT, PURSUED BY A BEAR by Lauren Gunderson, directed by Steve M. Boyle

Running now through June 14 at City Lights Theater in San Jose!

>"Nan wants to teach her abusive husband, Kyle, a lesson. With her friend Simon by her side as her emotional cheerleader, and a stripper named Sweetheart along for the fun, Nan tapes Kyle to a chair and forces him to watch as they reenact scenes from their painful past. In the pièce de résistance, she plans to cover the room in meat and honey, and leave Kyle to be mauled by a bear. After a night of emotional trials and ridiculous theatrics, Nan and Kyle are both freed from their past in this dark and delightful revenge comedy."

###Townhall Theatre Company presents MOON OVER BUFFALO by by Ken Ludwig, directed by Scott Fryer

Running now through June 15 at Townhall Theatre Company in Lafayette!

>"A slam-bang farce from the author of "Lend Me A Tenor", "Moon Over Buffalo" focuses on George & Charlotte Hay, two fading stars of the 1950s. About to give up all hope of stardom, they receive word that they might just have one last shot: Frank Capra is coming to town to see their matinee, and if likes what he sees, he might cast them in his movie remake of The Scarlet Pimpernel. Unfortunately for them, everything that might go wrong does in this hysterically funny comedy."

Heather Kellogg, a friend of mine and a fabulous actor, plays Rosalind and I know without a doubt she's totally rocking in. So don't miss out!

Pharus is a brash, young gay man; Bobby, a well-connected legacy student. When these two compete to lead the legendary choir at their elite African-American prep school, their confrontations lead to huge revelations about identity, loyalty and friendship."

##JULY

###Wily West Productions presents I SAW IT and ZERO HOUR: THE MARS EXPERIMENT

July 17 - August 8 at the EXIT Theatre in San Francisco!

Playwrights include: Jennifer Lynne Roberts, Melissa Keith, Jaene Leonard, Charles Lewis III, Morgan Ludlow, Laylah Muran de Assereto, Conrad Panganiban, Bridgette Dutta Portman, and Karl Schackne. Both shows will be directed by the WONDERFUL Ariel Craft.

ZERO HOUR: THE MARS EXPERIMENT

>"Would you leave everything behind, all the comforts of earthly life—friends, family, ice cream, sex—for the experiment? To live in isolation and the experience taped for a reality show for the people back home on Earth, so that you can be a pioneer, the first to colonize the planet Mars? These six humans did. They left their jobs. Some lost their families. They underwent physical and mental evaluations. They signed contracts. They trained. They made love for the last time. And at ZERO HOUR, they made peace with their decision. But that was six months and sixty-eight days ago."

I SAW IT

>"Did you? An anomalous event has occurred. A city in ruins. Some are saying it wasn’t an act of nature, but a creature, a shadow, a…something. Rumors run rampant, suspicions run high. The #ISawIt hashtag has gone viral. Unsubstantiated reports, conspiracy theories, panic! Does Isla have the answers everyone wants? The government thinks so. Inside an interrogation room, Isla is questioned while outside, a city tries to recover."
