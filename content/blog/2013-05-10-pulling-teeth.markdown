title: Pulling Teeth
---

99% of the time I love, love, *love* working on plays that I write. 99% of the time. Then sometimes theres a script or a deadline that just gets under my skin. Right now I have a script that I don't want to work on *and* a deadline that I don't want to meet. I've been avoiding both for weeks. Luckily with me being so busy I can get away with it pretty easily... But there are no swim classes this afternoon (Monday through Thursday I take my kids to swim class from 4-6), and I have nothing else I'm supposed to be writing or working on and so... So, here it goes... I'm ready to pull some teeth and hair, and hate every freakin' minute of it... I hope in the end the script and I both are better for it.
