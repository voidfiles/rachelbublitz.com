title: Thank You For Supporting THE FANTASY CLUB
---

Yesterday we raised $575! Thank you to everyone who donated, and shared our project! Specially, I would like to shout out to: [Katy Kessinger](https://twitter.com/katymsrd), Peter Townley, [Stuart Bousel](http://endymionrising.blogspot.com/), [Patrick Brennan](https://twitter.com/pmbrennan), Lauren Alise Cooney, [Jordan Stanway](http://www.mbari.org/staff/mjstanway/), [Colin Potter](https://plus.google.com/114864126283340818133/posts), [Laylah Muran de Assereto](http://www.linkedin.com/in/laylahm), and [Colleen Egan](http://www.grittycityrep.org/gcr#!__gcr/staff-bios)! THANK YOU! There were also a few folks who generously donated that didn't wish to be publicly thanked, we know who you are and we thank you in our hearts!

We are 14% of the way there with only 15 days to go! Please, please, please, help us reach our goal! Every $1 helps, and anything that makes you laugh as hard as Barb the Phone Sex Operator deserves at least $1, right?

Thank you!!!!!!!!!

Oh, ha! Here's the link again, for you to donate:
