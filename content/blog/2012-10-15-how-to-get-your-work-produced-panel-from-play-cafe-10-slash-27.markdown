###HOW TO GET YOUR WORK PRODUCED

Panel Discussion

Saturday, October 27, 2012

2pm - 6pm

$35 admission includes pizza and beer!

Featuring Advice and Experience from Stuart Bousel, Anthony Clarvoe, Megan Cohen, Judith Offer, and Don Reed

Moderated by Tracy Held Potter, Norman Gee, and Jamie Greenblatt

Our panel represents decades of experience from playwrights who have had their work produced locally, regionally, and nationally, self-produced, gotten work accepted into festivals, and have been invited to write on commission. Our panelists have written one-acts, full-lengths, musicals, and full-length solo pieces. We will open the discussion with moderated questions to the entire panel, and then we will break off into smaller groups for playwrights to interact with one or two of our panelists for questions and more in-depth discussion. The afternoon will conclude with social time, pizza, beer, and other refreshments.
