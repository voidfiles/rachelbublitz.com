title: Reading With City Lights Theater Company in San Jose
---

Yesterday I was notified that my ten minute play *Horny Like The Wolf* will be read on April 9th down in San Jose's [City Lights Theater Company](http://obsidianartspace.org/big-head-productions.html). *Horny Like The Wolf* will join 6 other short plays for an evening of staged readings. And there will be a talk back with the playwrights after. For those of you who missed the reading at [Masquers Playhouse](http://www.masquers.org/) you have another chance at seeing this hilarious play! More details to come as they are announced, so stay tuned!
