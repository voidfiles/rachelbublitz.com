title: I Got Achilles!
---

Super, SUPER, excited to announce that I'll be one of the talented writers for next year's [SF Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/)! I'm writing the full length for Achilles, the date is 11/9th! I decided a while back that I was so excited about the play I proposed I was writing it anyway (whether I got in our not), but getting in is really wonderful. I'm currently reading my third book of research for the piece, and I'm glad to be able to tell folks what I'm actually researching! Ha. So mark your calendars. And, check out the other amazing writers set for next year:
