title: Teaching Adventure Starts Tomorrow
---

If you haven't heard, I'm teaching high school students how to write plays for a six week workshop! Tomorrow is my first day, and my body is starting to go from excited to nervous and wondering why in the world it's brain signed up for such a thing, but that's part of the fun, right? Right?

When I do get very nervous, I remind myself that this is the first job (that *pays* me money) I've had that's writing related. And, get this, it pays me more than I have to pay for childcare... Living the dream, I am. 

But in all serious and honesty, I am very excited for this opportunity. Tomorrow I might be singing a different tune, but you'll have to check back in and read my post about my first day teaching, tomorrow!
