Working these days has been strange (to say the least), and I'm maybe a 25% as productive as I normally am... And that might even be pretty generous. But a bright spot has been working on my ten-minute play [*MY BODY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2541/my-body) for [Concord Theatrical](https://www.concordtheatricals.com/)'s [45th Annual Samuel French Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival](https://oobfestival.com/)! In normal years I'd be headed out to NYC in a few months for a production of the play, but this year is anything BUT normal. So instead we were encouraged to put together some local development, in order to find the kinks we'd normally discover through a rehearsal process.

After a Zoom reading and an in person, but socially distanced, rehearsal with some amazing local artists- director/dramaturg Alexandra Harbold, and actors Susana Florence, and Aaron Adams- I am feeling SO confident about this play! It's always had teeth, but now it has a chain saw. Even if it is not ultimately selected as one of the top six, I am proud of the work we did and wow wow wow, I had no idea how much I needed to get together with other artists and just mess around with words.  

If you'd like to give it a read, head on over to the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2541/my-body), where I just posted the brand new draft!

Happy Wednesday!
