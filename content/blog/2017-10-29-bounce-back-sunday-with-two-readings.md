+++

I'm bouncing back into action today with TWO readings of new plays! This morning at my friend's lovely apartment, we'll be reading the first draft of my play *BURST*, so that I can get it ready for a November 2nd submission deadline, and then this evening I'll be working with [Quantum Dragon Theatre](https://www.quantumdragon.org/) and hearing my first draft of *HAPPILY*. Busy-ness is the balm that soothes all that ails me. Plus, since I'm a nervous wreck before I hear any of my plays out loud, my anxiety will distract me from all those other pesky feelings. Win win! 

Happy Sunday everyone and stay tuned, I'll be announcing the date for the public reading of *HAPPILY* with Quantum Dragon's The Forge soon!
