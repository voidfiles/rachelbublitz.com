title: One Week Until WOMEN IN SOLODARITY
---

We are one week away from opening night of [WOMEN IN SOLODARITY, CAT LADIES](https://www.facebook.com/events/102148146638070/?fref=ts). The show is great, and you don't want to miss out. The show on April 5th (my birthday) has already sold out! Thank you world for that wonderful birthday present. Anyway, there are still tickets for the other performances, but I'm told that they're filling up quickly. Be sure and [buy tickets soon](http://catladies.brownpapertickets.com/) so you don't miss out on this fabulous show featuring new work from local women, preformed by awesome local female talent!
