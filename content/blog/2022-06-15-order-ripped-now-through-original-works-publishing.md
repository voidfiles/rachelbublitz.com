[*RIPPED*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/ripped) has been published with [Original Works Publishing](https://www.originalworksonline.com/)!!! Original Works Publishing is all about bold and innovative new plays, and I am thrilled to have my play join their catalog.

[*RIPPED* was the winner of the 2020 Glickman Award](https://www.dramatistsguild.com/news/bublitz-wins-2020-will-glickman-award) for best premiere play in the Bay Area, was nominated for seven Theatre Bay Area Awards, and made multiple "Best of 2019" lists! Now you can not only add this provocative new play to your library, but you can also make all production inquiries directly to Original Works!

*RIPPED* is a cast of three, college aged actors, with tons of fantastic two-person scenes, as well as a few knock-out monologues from the character Lucy. I wish I'd had this play to work with when I was a young actor picking material in college. Which also makes it a great gift for the young actors in your lives!
