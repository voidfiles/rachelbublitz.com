More about the play:

>"When aliens invade a small town and abduct the high school football team to steal their brain jelly, no one steps up to save them. Not the parents, not the principal, not the police, not the fire department, not the governor, not even the marines. Thankfully there's one last group no one ever thought of as heroic, and they're ready and able to kick some alien butt... the Greenville High School Cheerleading Squad use rhymes, cartwheels, glitter, and a fun-ton of tinfoil to save the day!"
