I am closer to having a public performance during each month of this year! [*MY BODY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2541/my-body) has been selected for production by George Washington University's student run company the [14th Grade Players](https://www.facebook.com/14GWU/)! *MY BODY* will have an upperclassmen directing incoming freshman for their "Welcome Back One-Acts" show. The show will run for five performances between 9/27 (8pm), 9/28 (8pm and 10pm), and 9/29 (8pm and 10pm).

Now I only need November and December for a full calendar year! Eeeeeeeeeeee!

Happy Wednesday!
