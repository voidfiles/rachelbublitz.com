You can't see me, so you don't realize, but right at this moment I am doing a very happy dance. [*The Book Women*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/products/the-book-women) is out! It's available! And the cover art is breathtakingly beautiful!

Last April when [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/) approached me to write a play about librarians delivering books via horseback during the Great Depression, I leapt at the opportunity. It was such a joy to dig into this rich history and learn the story of these women, and this community in Eastern Kentucky. The play poured out of me easier than any I have ever written, and I am OVERJOYED that it is now out in the world and ready for production.

You can read the entire script *for free* at [yourstagepartners.com/](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/), and I hope you will! And then send it to all the theater educators you know, because I want to see this play done at schools around the country.

Happy Tuesday! Stay safe! Stay healthy! Stay sane!
