title: MUCH ADO ABOUT MATHLETES is going to London
---

I got some exciting news this morning, my one-act *Much Ado About Mathletes* will join [Gatton Community Theatre](http://www.gattoncommunitytheatre.org.uk/index.htm)'s young actor showcase [Scratch Scripts](https://www.facebook.com/events/1498944370355016/)! Hooray! This is like the little play that could.
