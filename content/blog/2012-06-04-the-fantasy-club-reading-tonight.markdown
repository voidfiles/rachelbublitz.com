title: THE FANTASY CLUB reading TONIGHT!
---

Tonight is the night my friends. Tonight, "The Fantasy Club" my (first) full length play will get a staged reading! I'm tremendously excited, and strangely much less nervous from yesterday. Right now I feel pretty damn confident that my actors and director will knock this one out of the park.

I'm hoping for a crowd, it is a comedy so I need folks in chairs to laugh! I know it's raining, but this will be better than an evening in front of the TV! Come out and support an up and coming local playwright. Support local art! I do not plan on disappointing anyone.
