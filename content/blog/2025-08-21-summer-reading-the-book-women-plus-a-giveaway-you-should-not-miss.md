I'm back! Later than expected, but that's life sometimes. The US Water Polo Junior Olympics was packed with high and lows and I needed a few weeks to put my head back together. But I couldn't finish off the summer without getting you my last two summer recommendations!

And so, today I'm recommending you read one of my very favorite plays today, [*The Book Women*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/the-book-women), which is available through [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/). *The Book Women* has something for everyone; comedy, drama, history, singing, exciting design possibilities, a large flexible cast, and even a small touch of romance.

Here's the synopsis for *The Book Women*:

>*In the midst of the Great Depression, in a community crushed by the collapse of coal, and isolated by the very mountains they call home, a group of determined librarians take to their horses to reach the people of Eastern Kentucky. With a dedication equal to the US Postal Service, these â€œBook Women'' deliver more than the books and magazines they carry in their saddlebags. They bring hope. They bring dreams. They bring the promise that if we support one another, tomorrow will be better.*

Find [*The Book Women* with Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/the-book-women)! The play has a run-time between 75 and 90 minutes, and a very flexible cast between 7 and 30+, with an ideal number somewhere near 20 with doubling.

And today just might be your lucky day, because for the next two days (deadline 8/23/2025), [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/) is giving away 10,000 books to celebrate their 10th anniversary! [So rush over before it's too late and use code 10THEANNIVERSARY](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/) for up to three free scripts!

Happy Thursday!
