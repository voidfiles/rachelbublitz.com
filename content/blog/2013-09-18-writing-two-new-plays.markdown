title: Writing TWO New Plays
---

Just started work on TWO brand new, *very* different plays. Different from one another, and different from anything I've ever written. I'm trying to stretch myself and do my MFA all the way!

First off, I have (I think it'll be 30-45 minutes) a children's play (yes a play *for* children!) called either *Clever Catherine*, or *The Clever Queen*. It's adorable. And I've only had to stop myself from writing inappropriate things like a dozen times so far. Woo! 

Number two is a HORROR play! You probably don't know this, but I'm a super wimp when it comes to scary things... Scary movies, scary shows, scary stories, they get to me. So I'm trying to funnel that into one scary f***ing play (see what I mean about the inappropriate things?). It will probably be called *Rosie, Bloody Rosie*. It is about a female serial killer, and after I wrote the outline, I had nightmares. 1/2 way through a very rough draft, and I'm itching to get it done so I can push my limits even farther with draft 2! It's going to be a long one-act (I'm hoping to land around 65-75 pages).

Excited? Good! So am I.
