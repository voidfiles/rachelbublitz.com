title: Off To Rehearsal For THE FANTASY CLUB
---

I've just had my Sunday morning waffle, and now I'm off to the first rehearsal for the staged reading of THE FANTASY CLUB. I'm excited and incredibly nervous. For some reason, I'm much, much, much, much more nervous than I ever was speaking in front of large quantities of people. Go figure.

Well, I really need to get dressed now. Wish me luck! Oh, and be sure and come by the Off Market Theatre TOMORROW at 7:30! Especially if you are fond of laughing. Have a nice Sunday!
