title: General Auditions for Playwrights Center of SF Spring Season 3/11
---

My full length comedy "The Fantasy Club" will be a part of this reading series. Here's the information for any of you interested in audition for it:

General auditions for the Playwrights’ Center of San Francisco’s (PCSF)
spring season will be held on Sunday March 11, from 12 to 3 p.m.  at the
Ray of Light Studios, 965 Mission St. Suite 350 in San Francisco. Actors
will be seen by producers, playwrights and directors for three staged
readings and six developmental readings held in San Francisco this April
and June. Staged readings require between six and twelve hours rehearsal.
 Developmental readings only require that you be present on the night of
the reading. You’ll be working with all new material.  This is a great way
to build your résumé and network with other playwrights while supporting
new Bay Area theater. Reading dates and venue info will be available at
the auditions.

Auditions are by appointment only. We’d like to see a two minute
contemporary monologue.

To schedule an audition appointment, please email your headshot and resume
to ann@playwrightscentersf.org . Please respond no later than 3/10/2012 to
ensure an audition spot.
