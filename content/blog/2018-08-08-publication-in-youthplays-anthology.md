My ten-minute TYA play [*NO TALKING ALLOWED!*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/no-talking-allowed-by-rachel-bublitz-505) has been published with [YouthPLAYS](https://www.youthplays.com/) as a stand alone piece, AND in an anthology! It's a fun and silly short piece for performers of all ages.

Here's the synopsis for *NO TALKING ALLOWED!*:

"Jordan gets kicked out of class for talking. But a zero on the test may be the least of Jordan’s problems when a pencil starts to talk—and then a locker and a mop and a slew of other inanimate objects. Maybe Jordan’s going crazy, but Jordan’s not the only one, as soon a hall monitor, the custodian, a teacher and the principal join in as they try to get to the bottom of all the yammering in this comedy inspired by an African folk tale."

The anthology, [*It's Elementary! Twelve Short Plays for Upper Elementary Actors*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/its-elementary-twelve-short-plays-for-upper-elementary-school-actors-512) also includes plays by: [Nicole B. Adkins](https://newplayexchange.org/users/818/nicole-adkins), Robin Blasberg, Matt Buchanan, [Catherine Castellani](https://newplayexchange.org/users/711/catherine-castellani), [Annie Harrison Elliott](https://newplayexchange.org/users/3844/annie-harrison-elliott), [Claudia Haas](https://newplayexchange.org/users/948/claudia-haas), [Arthur M. Jolly](https://newplayexchange.org/users/753/arthur-m-jolly), [Laura King](https://newplayexchange.org/users/5333/laura-king), [Meredith Dayna Levy](https://newplayexchange.org/users/3754/meredith-dayna-levy), [Anne Negri](https://newplayexchange.org/users/14344/anne-negri), and [Isabella Russell-Ides](https://newplayexchange.org/users/22261/isabella-russell-ides).

Here's more about the anthology:

"Twelve short plays offer a varied and flexible collection of performance opportunities for upper elementary students. With fast-paced, large-cast comedies that range from clever to downright wacky, meaty dramatic challenges for more advanced actors or something in between, the plays of *It’s Elementary!* are there to entertain while exploring age-appropriate concerns. Whether it’s navigating an unfamiliar environment, coping with learning differences at school or taking on new responsibilities, this collection has something to offer every young actor."
