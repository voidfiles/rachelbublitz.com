Home again, home again, jiggity jig! I'm back in Salt Lake after an amazing and rainy trip back to the Bay Area. Highlights of the trip include catching up with so many great friends and collaborators, taking the entire day on Sunday to just walk and talk and eat all over San Francisco with one of my best friends (and basically one of the best people on the planet), hearing *HAPPILY* read before an audience for the first time ever, and a really exciting meeting I had with the artistic director of one of my favorite companies. Woo!

Huge thank you to everyone at [Quantum Dragon Theatre](https://www.quantumdragon.org/), my director Melinda Marks, and my wonderful cast for the *HAPPILY* reading; Stephanie Ann Foster, Erika Bakse, Jessica Rudholm, Matt Gunnison, and Jess Thomas. I have tons of ideas for the future of this play, and a solid plan on how to get it to where I want it to go. 

And for those of you who don't know, [the Forge Reading Series](https://www.quantumdragon.org/the-forge-2017) continues for the rest of the month! I highly encourage you to check out the remaining three plays: 

Monday, January 15th, 2018 @ 7:30pm: *PROTOTYPE* by Christina Bauer, directed by Kari Barclay

Monday, January 22nd, 2018 @ 7:30pm: *CREATURE FEATURE* by Claire Ann Rice, directed by Tony Cirimele

Tuesday, January 30th, 2018 @ 7:30pm: *ACCOMMODATIONS* by Jennifer Lynne Roberts, directed by Jacinta Sutphin

I'm hoping to make it out again soon, with some great possibilities on the horizon. So never fear, if I missed you this trip, I'll be back before you know it. 

Happy Wednesday everyone!
