title: More Reasons To Give To The SF Olympians Festival
---

Isn't that how it always is? Finish a post, then think of more you wish you'd put in there? Well today that's the case for me! I thought of some more things you should know about this year's [San Francisco Olympians Festival](https://www.facebook.com/pages/San-Francisco-Olympians-Festival/282661841972?ref=stream&hc_location=stream), and more reasons why you should give:

1. You are helping fund 36 brand-spanking-new plays!
2. Lots of women playwrights! Of the 30 playwrights, 17 of them are ladies.
3. It's also a fine arts festival! Brand new works will be created by local fine artists, making that art community here in the bay area bigger and stronger!
4. You're also supporting local directors and actors! It's not just a festival for playwrights, we get everyone involved! And come November we'll have actors perform the plays as staged readings at [The Exit](http://www.theexit.org/) in downtown San Francisco.
5. Tickets are low so everyone can afford to see the shows! Tickets are only $10!
