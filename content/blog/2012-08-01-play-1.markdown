title: Play 1, Day 1
---

So, things did not go as planned today. I like to write first thing (after working out and a shower), but I was flooded with emails, and I had all sorts of things to post and I also had a few interviews ([31 Plays/31 Days](http://31plays31days.com) is blowing up out the box!), so I didn't write my play. I wrote it when the kids were home (key dramatic music). The boy is napping, the girl follows me around making funny noises... But I wrote anyway. I wrote without judgement, like my pal Tracy told me. Here it is, my first play... I can't promise I'll post all the plays I write this month, but as long as it can't ruin my life I'll try to. Not sure if what I was going for worked in this piece... Let me know what you think (and this is right off the burner, first draft!).


###First Date On The Brain, a ten minute play

By Rachel Bublitz


*JENNY sits at a table for two. Behind her on stage standing is JENNY’S BRAIN.*

JENNY’S BRAIN
He’s late. He’s late. Ugh. Why do I do this to myself? He’s probably secretly gay anyway... Or worse, maybe he saw me and left without me seeing! I hope I look okay. God, I’m hungry... Where is he?

*DANIEL enters, DANIEL’S BRAIN enters right behind him.*

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Please be her, please be her, please be her.

DANIEL
Jenny?

JENNY
Yes, hello! Daniel, right?

*JENNY rises and shakes DANIEL’s hand.*

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Hold eye contact, do not look at her boobs. Eye contact!

JENNY and DANIEL sit at the table. DANIEL’S BRAIN stands behind him.

DANIEL
Sorry I’m late, bart.

JENNY’S BRAIN
Great, he doesn’t even own a car.

JENNY
Don’t worry about it, I’ve only been here like 10 minutes.

JENNY’S BRAIN
Try thirty.

JENNY
So, I’ve never been here before, what’s good?

*JENNY grabs a menu and begins to look through it.*

DANIEL’S BRAIN
She’s not looking! Those are nice tits. Damn, it’s been so long since I’ve touched breasts. I wonder how soft they are.

DANIEL
I like the burger, they put a friend egg on top. It’s unbelievable.

JENNY’S BRAIN
He eats meat?

JENNY
Oh, I’m vegetarian.

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Shiiiiiiiit.

DANIEL
They have a veggie pizza that’s good too. I was thinking of getting that. I’ve been trying to cut back on meat lately. It’s just so...

JENNY’S BRAIN
Bad for the environment, your health, cruel to animals...?

DANIEL
Expensive, you know?

JENNY
Yeah, it can be pricey.

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Idiot. Stop staying stupid shit or there will be no sex! Think, think, think....

DANIEL
So, you’re a writer, right?

JENNY’S BRAIN
Ugh.

JENNY
Yea, pretty much.

DANIEL
What do you write?

JENNY
I write plays.

JENNY’S BRAIN
Wait for it, wait for it...

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Plays? Theatre? Shit, think of a play, any play... Um, wasn’t “A Few Good Men” a play first? Shit, I can’t remember. Think of a play!

DANIEL
Like “Wicked”?

JENNY’S BRAIN
And there it is.

JENNY
“Wicked” is a musical. I write plays.

DANIEL
Oh, yeah, I knew that. Have you had any of your plays put up? 

JENNY
Not yet.

DANIEL
Oh. How do you make money from that?

JENNY
I don’t really make much money. I’m a assitant for a law firm during the day.

JENNY’S BRAIN
I am such a loser. How can I tell people I’m a playwright if I haven’t even had one play produced. God, he must be thinking I’m so lame right now.

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Shit, I’ve embarrassed her. First I sound like an idiot, and now I’m making her feel bad. 

JENNY
What about you? 

DANIEL
I teach.

JENNY
Oh yeah? What grade?

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Please don’t think I’m a weirdo, or kid crazy...

DANIEL
Kindergarten.

JENNY’S BRAIN
Oh crap, he must really like kids. I wonder if he wants kids right away? I can’t have a kid right now. I’m still figuring out what I want in life. I’m so not ready for kids right now. Babies are so cute though...

JENNY
You must really like kids.

DANIEL
Yeah.

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Pivot, pivot!

DANIEL
I’m really glad that Micah set us up, I don’t go out too much.

JENNY
Micah is the best, isn’t he?

DANIEL
Yeah, he’s a great guy. Funny.

JENNY
So funny!

JENNY’S BRAIN
This date is going nowhere fast. We haven’t even ordered and we’re out of things to talk about. I haven’t had sex in six months though. How do I let him know I’ll sleep with him without him thinking I’m a total slut?

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Think of a topic... Damn her lips are beautiful. What do they feel like? Focus! Focus! Say something, anything!

DANIEL
Want to see a picture of my dog?

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Please be a dog person, please be a dog person...

JENNY
You have a dog?

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Please be a dog person.

*DANIEL pulls out his phone and shows JENNY a picture of his dog.*

DANIEL
His name is Goose.

JENNY
Oh my God, what a cutie! I love dogs.

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Yes!

JENNY
Did you name him after Goose from Top Gun?

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Hell yes!

DANIEL
Yeah, it’s my favorite movie.

JENNY
I love that movie. I’m always ashamed to admit it though.

JENNY’S BRAIN
Don’t insult his favorite movie! 

DANIEL
There’s nothing wrong with Top Gun. Like it with pride!

JENNY
I’ll work on that... How old is Goose?

DANIEL
He’s three. He’s great, a total goof ball, but what else can you expect? He loves running around dog beach-

JENNY
(Interrupting) You take him to dog beach? I used to go there all the time with my dog.

DANIEL
You have a dog?

JENNY
Had, she died a few years ago, I’d had her since I was a teenager.

DANIEL’S BRAIN
No more questions about the dead dog!

JENNY’S BRAIN
I miss my puppy. Maybe I should get a new dog, no they’re so much responsibility, I just can’t do that right now... Look at his 
hands, they’re so strong... And those arms, can we skip dinner please? Pay attention now, sex is on the line. 

DANIEL
Yeah, I take him out every Saturday morning.

JENNY’S BRAIN
That’s tomorrow! Say it, say it!

JENNY
Tomorrow?

DANIEL
Yeah, I guess tomorrow is Saturday.

JENNY
Maybe I could come with you?

JENNY’S BRAIN
Oh, no he’s going to think I’m clingy and crazy. I just want to sleep with you, that’s all this is, I promise!

DANIEL
Sure, that’d be fun, we could meet there...

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Or go there together after a beautiful night of fucking.

JENNY
Or we could go there together... If you wanted.

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Did she just say that?

JENNY
I’m not too hungry, are you?

DANIEL’S BRAIN
I hate food!

DANIEL
I’m not hungry at all. I live right next to bart, should we...

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Please say yes, please say yes....

JENNY
I have a car, let’s drive.

JENNY’S BRAIN
I can’t believe I’m actually doing this! We haven’t even had dinner yet, I don’t even know his last name! But look at those 
eyes. Ooooh.

DANIEL’S BRAIN
She owns a car! She’s a Goddess!

*JENNY and DANIEL rise.*

JENNY
Shall we?

DANIEL
Abso-fucking-lutely.

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Stop saying stupid shit.

*DANIEL takes out a few bucks and throws is on the table.*

JENNY’S BRAIN
What a gentleman!

*As JENNY moves to exit, DANIEL kisses her.*

DANIEL’S BRAIN
Oh, she’s so soft. Don’t grab her ass yet, keep is classy, we’re still in public. Keep those hands up. Damn she’s a good kisser.

JENNY’S BRAIN
Wow, go easy with the tongue there, fella’.... That’s better. 

*End of play.*
