---

It's [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/playwrightbinge/) day 6, and I'm behind! Here's what I submitted today to help catch me up...

[Big Head Productions](http://obsidianartspace.org/big-head-productions.html) is seeking plays ranging from 5-15 minutes with the theme dark and twisted fairy tale. I just email over my short play *Baby Pie*. If you're looking to submit, they'd like you to email your script as a pdf by April 1st.

[Thespian Productions](http://www.thespianproduction.com/submissions.htm) wants plays less that are less than 15 minutes for their Theatre Madness showcase coming this summer. They want plays without profanity or nudity that have not been produced in New York City. I've sent them my play *We're All Going To Die*. The deadline for submitting is March 31, 2013.

[Sonoma Stage Works](http://www.sonomastageworks.org/playfest.html) wants plays that are either 10 minutes or 30 minutes in length. You must live in the Bay Area, and the deadline is March 15, 2013. I sent in my ten minute play *Horny Like The Wolf*.

[Piney Fork Press Theater](http://pineyforkpress.com/) wants 10 minutes plays without nudity or profanity. You may submit up to three plays, and the deadline is May 1, 2013. I sent them *Her Special Day*, *Garbage Disposal*, and *We're All Going To Die*.

That brings my tally up to 6! Officially caught up.
