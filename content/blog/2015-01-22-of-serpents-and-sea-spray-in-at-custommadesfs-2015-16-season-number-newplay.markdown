title: 'OF SERPENTS AND SEA SPRAY In @CustomMadeSF''s 2015/16 Season #newplay'
---

SO incredibly beyond thrilled and excited to announce that my full-length play OF SERPENTS & SEA SPRAY will be produced in [Custom Made Theatre](custommade.org)'s 2015/16 season! Keep your January and February clear, because now you've got plans. OF SERPENTS & SEA SPRAY will be directed by [Ariel Craft]()!

Here's more about the play:

>"World Premiere!

>Jan-Feb '15: OF SERPENTS AND SEA SPRAY by Rachel Bublitz. Directed by Assistant Artistic Director, Ariel Craft.

>OF SERPENTS AND SEA SPRAY, a CMTC commission written by emerging Bay Area playwright Rachel Bublitz, tells the story of an orphan named Iro who is the subject of ridicule by other children and punishment by uncaring foster parents. During one of her many tours through solitary confinement in the closet, Iroâ€™s imagination brings her with a mission: find Pegasus. On her quest, taking with her only books and her imaginary friend Annika, Iro hides herself on an ocean liner, joins a circus, and has many other adventures... and along the way finds the truth about the death of her parents.

>In SERPENTS, Bublitz embraces the playfulness and malleability of a child's imagination while she courageously wrestles with the harshest of realities that occasionally invade our lives far too early and well before we're equipped for them. Through the example of our heroine, Bublitz asks the audience to address the balance of light and dark within our own lives, and the inextricable link between the two."

I might combust from joy right now. 

More to come. All the things to come! 

Jan/Feb 2016 baby!
