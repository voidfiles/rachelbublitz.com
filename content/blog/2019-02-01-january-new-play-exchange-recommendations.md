I tried to keep myself busy through January, with lots of rewrites, submissions (yes, submissions that I’m NOT counting), teaching, and reading of new plays. And I can say I for sure got a lot of reading done. The [52 Plays by Women](https://twitter.com/52playsbywomen) challenge helps for sure, but I didn’t stop there… Here are all the plays I recommended last month on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard):
