My one-act play [*BREAK ROOM*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/45988/break-room), written for the 2015 [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://sfolympians.com/), has been selected for Winthrop University's Spring One Acts happening this April! A directing student found the play on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) (thank you *again* New Play Exchange!) and I granted them rights to put on the play!

*BREAK ROOM* was inspired by the Greek witch, Circe. In my conception of the play I thought a lot about how our society sexualizes young women, and then punishes them for acting out that sexuality. It is a coming of age story in which my main character is forced to come of age far too quickly. I hope the students of Winthrop University find it a fulfilling and challenging story to tell, and I am so thrilled that they came searching for new work and stumbled upon my play.

I have more exciting things to announce on the horizon, so stay tuned!
