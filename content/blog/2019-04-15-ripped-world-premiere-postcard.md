It's getting really really real! A week from tomorrow is our first rehearsal, I can't wait to dig into this script with my brilliant director, Lisa Steindler, and fantastic cast, Krystle Piamonte, Edwin Jacobs, and Daniel Chung! This is a playwright dream for sure.

And you can join me in this wonderful dream! YOU can buy tickets and come and see my show. The world premiere of a play that I've been working on since my second semester of grad school. Nothing would make me happier. I'll be around from first previews through opening night, so please please say hello if you make it that first week.

You can buy your tickets right here: [www.zspace.org/rippedshow](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow)!

And feel free to invite one or one hundred friends to join you!
