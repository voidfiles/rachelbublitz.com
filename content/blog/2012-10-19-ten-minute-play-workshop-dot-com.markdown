title: Ten Minute Play Workshop
---

On Wednesday the [Ten Minute Play Workshop](http://www.tenminuteplayworkshop.com/) read my short play GHOST STORY and then had a critique session. To hear the podcast, [go here](http://www.tenminuteplayworkshop.com/2012/10/session-24-rachel-bublicks-ghost-story.html).

It was a lot of fun, I hope that I have the opportunity to participate again in the future. You can also sign up to give feedback on the sessions, if you're interested.
