title: AEOLUS and BREAK ROOM (or CIRCE) Coming Up November 19 With The San Francisco
  Olympians Festival!
---

This year's [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) is off to a great start, and I'm feeling on top of the world! Last night my cast for BREAK ROOM, based on the myth of Circe, KILLED in rehearsal. There was even a moment we had to stop and take a break because one of the actors was laughing too hard to talk. Now, it's not all fun and games with this play, there's some serious stuff that goes down for sure, but I love having that juxtaposition of comedy with holy crap, what happened. BREAK ROOM is about two people who are trying to make their relationship work, it takes place in a Target break room, where they both work. 

For my prize, (you did know there are *prizes* didn't you?), I'm giving a romantic evening in a bag complete with wine, chocolate, massage oil, and tea candles, all purchased from the play's location: Target! There's only ONE way to win, you have to show up and enter the raffle.

Also up that night is Kirk Shimano's new play AEOLUS:

>"A starship captain encounters an alien race with three argumentative souls in one body. But why is the human the one fighting himself?"

Our director is Claire Rice, and we have a top-notch acting crew of Tony Cirimele, Becky Raeta, and Matt Gunnison. 

It's not a not to be missed, the show is Thursday, November 19th at 8pm at the [Exit Theatre](http://www.theexit.org/). Click on over and buy yourself a ticket before it's too late: [http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2194756](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2194756)
