Yesterday was AWESOME! DOMA and Prop 8 were struck down, a woman standing up for what she believes in was victorious in Texas, and on a much smaller scale, WE MADE OUR FUNDRAISING GOAL! Thank you Kristoffer Alberto, Rob Reeves, Karissa George, Bridgette Portman, Nikki DeBraccio, Allison Stensrude, and Patrick Brennan (who, by upping his original pledge, took us up to the 4k mark!). You guys are rock stars!

A huge, HUGE thank you too all the lovely people who have donated so far! You are ALL rock stars! And I am so thrilled that *The Fantasy Club* will be produced in August! No more ifs! 

We're really hoping that we can push the goal to $5,000, so keep telling the world about our campaign! And if you need a reason to do that, take a look at this: [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz/posts/522466](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz/posts/522466). It's our newest video (yes, more videos!), and it features BIKER BUBLITZ.... So, you have to find out what *that* is, right?

Thank you again! We're thrilled!
