It's [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/playwrightbinge/info) day 9! I've made 13 submissions so far (trying to finish early, that's kind of my thing). Anyway, my next submissions were all for one spot!

[Independents Play(w)rights](http://independentplaywrights.com/) publish new plays! They have a ten-minute play contest going on right now. You can submit one play for each of their categories. And those categories are....

* The Female Anti-Hero
* Refurbished Fairy Tales
* Deadly Comedies
* The Empty Space
* A Night at the Opera
* The Not so Distant Future...
* A Question of Life and Death
* Dear Reader

Winning playwrights will be paid $75, and their plays will be published in an anthology. Please visit the contest page for all the details: [http://independentplaywrights.com/pages/ten-minute-play-contest](http://independentplaywrights.com/pages/ten-minute-play-contest).

I sent in *Baby Pie*, *My Body*, *Horny Like The Wolf*, *My Night With A Hooker*, *Good-Good Meal*, and *Nap Time*. 

Only 17 more submissions to go!
