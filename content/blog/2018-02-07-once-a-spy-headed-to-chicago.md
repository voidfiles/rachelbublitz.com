Now for my windy city news... My full-length play *ONCE A SPY*- about real WWII spy Nancy Wake- is getting a workshop and staged reading with [20% Theatre Company Chicago](https://www.twentypercentchicago.com/)’s [DarkRoom Series](https://www.twentypercentchicago.com/darkroom18)!! The reading will be directed by [Erin Kraft](https://www.erinkraft.com/about-1/), and after some conversations with Erin, it’s easy to see she’s a new play super stay and I’m so thankful 20% Theatre Company connected me with such a engaging and smart collaborator. I can't wait to dig in deeper on this play with her and our cast!

The reading is March 10th at 7pm at [Collaboraction Studios](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1579+N+Milwaukee+Ave,+Chicago,+IL+60622/@41.9103062,-87.6791339,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x880fd2c74476aaad:0x37c0119c18c56bbd!8m2!3d41.9103062!4d-87.6769452), and if you happen to be in Chicago, I sure hope you can make it out! 

As we get closer I’ll have more exciting news like casting and other fun things, so stay tuned! 

Chicago here I come!
