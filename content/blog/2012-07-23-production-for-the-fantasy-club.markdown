title: Production for THE FANTASY CLUB
---

I am overjoyed to announce that next (2013) fall, [All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/) will be producing "The Fantasy Club!" How rad is that? We don't have dates yet, but I will shout them from ALL the roof tops when we do, giving everyone plenty of times to mark their calendars and eliminating your ability to miss my show! As the details are worked out, I'll be posting them here, so stay tuned!
