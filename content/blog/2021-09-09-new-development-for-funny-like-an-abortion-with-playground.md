I am pleased as punch to announce that [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) has been selected for [PlayGround](https://playground-sf.org/)'s 2022 Festival of New Works! It will be a fully staged developmental production that, fingers crossed, will be both in person at [Potrero Stage](https://potrerostage.org/) in San Francisco, as well as streamed online. [Daysha Veronica](https://newplayexchange.org/users/40800/daysha-veronica)'s [*The Deliverance*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1522712/deliverance) will run along side *Funny, Like An Abortion*, as the other fully staged play in the festival. Both plays were featured earlier this year in Play Ground's Zoom Fest as staged readings.

In addition to the developmental productions, PlayGround's Festival of New Works will feature fully produced new short work with Best of Playground (the top six plays selected from PlayGround's Monday Night program), as well as staged readings of new full-length plays from the PlayGround Writer's Pool and Alumni. The festival and all its festivities will take place May 9-29, 2022. I am hoping so badly to be there!

The other spot of exciting PlayGround related news, is that I have also been selected as a 2021/22 Resident Writer! I'll be writing a brand new play and sharing pieces of it every month with my fellow residents. Check out the full line-up or residents and writers in PlayGround's 2021/22 pool [here](https://playground-sf.org/company/)!

Happy Thursday everyone!
