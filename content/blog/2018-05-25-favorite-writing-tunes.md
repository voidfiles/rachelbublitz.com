Hello and happy Friday!

I have one of those rare and wonderful days where my kids will be taken care of by other people until 5pm (an early Christmas miracle)! I have big BIG plans to get some work taken care of, including tackling my #submissionmission and finally finishing the first draft of a new TYA one-act. On writing/working days like these I gotta bring out the big guns music wise to keep my fingers tapping and the words flowing, here are some of my favorites tunes to write to:

For serious writing-writing: first drafts and major rip-apart rewrites:  

* Kind Of Blue - Miles Davis
* Tokyo Adagio - Charlie Haden & Gonzalo Rubalcaba
* Birthdays - Keaton Henson
* Bach: Unaccompanied Cello Suites - Yo-Yo Ma
* Shake Sugaree - Elizabeth Cotten
* In Roses - Gem Club
* Come Sunday - Charlie Haden & Hank Jones
* Ambient 1/Music For Airports - Brian Eno
