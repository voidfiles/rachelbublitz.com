Yes! Just finished my last script for my warm up. I think it has potential, but the ending (to me the hardest part) needs some TLC. I hope to make an announcement in the next couple of weeks about 31 plays in 31 days. The month is set for August, so get ready! I'll be looking for some crazy playwrights who want to join me on my quest!

Alright, now it's time to enjoy the beautiful weather. Hope your weekend ends well!
