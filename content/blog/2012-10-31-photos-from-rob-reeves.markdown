title: Photos From Rob Reeves
---

For a very long time, the picture that I used to represent myself on the interwebs was one that my husband took. I loved it. It was arty, and different.... And apparently terrible at representing what I actually look like. Can't have it all, can we? Luckily, my friend [Rob Reeves](http://suckypictures.blogspot.com) is a photographer and helped me out. We did this earlier this month, and thought I would share them with you! If you like what you see, and want Rob to take pictures for you [email him](mailto:robertdreeves@gmail.com). He's fun to work with, professional, and reasonably priced!

On an unrelated note... Happy Halloween! Go get sick on some candy.
