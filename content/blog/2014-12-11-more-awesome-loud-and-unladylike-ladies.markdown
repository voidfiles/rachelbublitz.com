title: More Awesome Loud And Unladylike Ladies
---

It takes a village to raise a child, and this is also true for theater festivals. It takes a village. And so I'd like to introduce you to two additional badasses in the [Loud & Unladylike](http://loudandunladylike.com/) village, Tonya Narvaez and Roxana Sorooshian!

Up on our tumblr page we have bios for both our phenomenal production manager, [Tonya Narvaez](http://loudandunladylike.com/post/104885667794/meet-our-production-manager) AND our fantastic Literary Manager/Dramaturg [Roxana Sorooshian](http://loudandunladylike.com/post/104884581129/meet-our-dramaturg-and-literary-manager)! Click on through and read all about them! Also feel free to subscribe to our tumblr, so you stay up to date on all things Loud & Unladylike. 

Announcements to come: our directors AND the 2016 submission details! Trust me, you don't want to miss any it.
