title: A Night At The Opera
---

This past Tuesday night, I went to see "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at Teatro dell'Opera di Roma. I've never seen a Shakespeare play as an Opera, and I've never seen an Opera in Rome, so this was pretty special. We went after a powerhouse sightseeing day in Rome in which we took in the Trevi Fountain, Colosseum, the Pantheon, Saint Peter's Basilica, roman ruins, The Spanish Steps, and a few smaller churches. I had to drink some coffee before the (nearly 4 hour) show to make sure I wouldn't collapse in exhaustion. 

The show was spectacular. That being said, it wasn't without flaws. While I think that the stories Shakespeare tells are wonderful for an Opera, I think his language is lost in the singing and there were a few actors who were a little weak. The fairy queen was out of this world talented and beautiful. And, as usual the play within the play stole the show. They were damn funny. The music was wonderful, and the theatre itself was breathtaking. All and all, a wonderful evening. And I didn't sleep! Thank you coffee. If you're in Rome, take in an Opera, we were in the very cheapest seats, they were 23 Euros (around $30) and could see very well. If you're tall, prepared to be uncomfortable though.

I'm in Italy for another week, but I'll be back and ready in July! Until then!
