I got my copy of The Rockford Review, the “Underneath” edition which includes my short  play “Bill and Kelly” in the mail a few days ago.  It’s pretty awesome, let me tell you.  I enjoyed seeing my words in a magazine very, very much.  If you haven’t already, go and buy a copy!  You can get one here:

I was proud and excited until my husband came home.  After he read my bio he said, “You didn’t list you email!  All the other writers list their email or website, see?”  Doh!  It was disappointing to realize that if someone out there was actually interested in my play they couldn’t contact me to let me know.  But whatever, now I’m on it.  No bio of mine will go out without contact info.  

Have you read “Bill and Kelly” in the Rockford Review?  Tell me what you think!
