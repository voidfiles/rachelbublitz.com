title: Reading Of AUDREY SCARE PEOPLE PLAY On 5/20 With San Francisco Theatre Pub
---

Time to get real guys... In one week my little girl's play will be staged in a reading for [San Francisco Theater Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/)'s [Pub From Another World](https://www.facebook.com/events/440212602739603/?fref=ts). Haven't heard of *Audrey Scare People Play*? [Click here](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2013/03/01/audrey-scare-people-play/) to read it. 

Here are all the details:

>"This strange brew of stories was concocted by Timothy Kay, Audrey Kessinger, Sang Kim, [Allison Page](https://twitter.com/AllisonLynnPage), Sunil Patel, [Bridgette Dutta Portman](http://www.bridgetteduttaportman.com/), [Kirk Shimano](http://kirkshimano.com/KirkShimano/Home.html), and [Marissa Skudlarek](http://marissabidilla.blogspot.com/). The intrepid troupe of actors includes Giovanna Arietta, Sam Bertken, Andrew Chung, AJ Davenport, Colleen Egan, Caitlin Evenson, Paul Jennings, Timothy Kay, Dan Kurtz, Meg Oâ€™Connor, Sunil Patel, Peter Townley, and Olivia Youngers.

>The wormhole will be open for one night only: Monday, May 20, at 8 PM at the [Cafe Royale](http://www.caferoyale-sf.com/). Admission is free and no reservations are required for this journey, but we recommend you come early for the best seats. Hyde Away Blues BBQ will provide food for all human guests."

The little girl of the hour will be in attendance, so come out and support theatre, children, and scaring people! And as a warning, I imagine it'll get pretty packed, so be sure and show up early.

See you next week!
