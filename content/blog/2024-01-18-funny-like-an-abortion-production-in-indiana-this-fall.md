My play [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion), a [National New Play Network](https://nnpn.org/) Rolling World Premiere, has just booked its fourth production! [Theatre Unchained](https://www.theatreunchained.org/) and [American Lives Theatre](https://americanlivestheatre.org/) will co-produce the play at [Indy Fringe](https://indyfringe.org/), which will open November 15, 2024!

With four full productions, *Funny, Like An Abortion* will be my most produced play that is strictly for an adult crowd! So if you haven't had a chance to read the play yet, I recommend you head over to the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) and do just that. It's pretty special.

My dream for this play is for it to run in every state in the country. A big dream for a *big* play. And now I can check Indiana off, along with New Jersey (Mile Square Theatre), Ohio ([Cleveland Public Theatre](https://www.cptonline.org/), the second production in the NNPN Rolling World Premiere), as well as another state which will be announced once I can announce the final production in the play's Rolling World Premiere.

You don't have to take my word for it, how *big* this play is, check out this incredible review from the [Mile Square Theatre](https://www.milesquaretheatre.org/) production this past Fall:
