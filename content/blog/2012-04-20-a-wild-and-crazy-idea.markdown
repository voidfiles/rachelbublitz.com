title: 31 Plays in 31 Days
---

I just had a wild and crazy idea. And, since it's very hot in Oakland today I'm going to go with it... I am going to write 31 plays in 31 days! Yes I am setting a goal, and a tremendous challenge for myself. In the month of August, I am going to write a ten minute play each day. This is especially hard for me, because I have a hard time with ten minute plays. My solution? Write a ton of them, and work it out. This isn't going to be easy, I'm probably going to cry, but here goes nothing. Any other playwrights want to join me? It might just be crazy enough to be fun! Email me!
