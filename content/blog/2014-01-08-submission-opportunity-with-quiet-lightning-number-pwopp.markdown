title: 'Submission Opportunity With Quiet Lightning #pwopp'
---

[Quiet Lightning](http://quietlightning.org/) is a monthly reading series and publication [sparkle + blink](http://quietlightning.org/sparkle) that travels around San Francisco, taking over different galleries, bars, and more to present new writers and their work. They look for all kids of different types of writing (8 minutes or less) and have a rolling deadline. 

If you're interested in getting involved, you can submit your work here: [https://quietlightning.submittable.com/submit/26143](https://quietlightning.submittable.com/submit/26143), deadline is January 15th. The only catch is that you must be around to present your work.

Good luck!
