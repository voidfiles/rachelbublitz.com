Yesterday felt like a pretty normal day. I went on a freezing 3 mile walk in the morning, was nose deep in fascinating/frustrating internet research (more on that later) most of the afternoon, and I got to announce the great news that *THE NIGHT WITCHES* will be published by Dramatic Publishing. So wonderful, but also, things I knew about.

And then I got my daughter from school. And we got home, she was having a snack and getting ready for swimming. And I got a call on my phone. It was from a mysterious number, which most of the time I won't answer, BUT it was a San Francisco area code and so I took the chance....

## And I was told [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) had been awarded the 2020 [Glickman Award](https://www.theatrebayarea.org/page/GlickmanAward)!

Every year a panel of leading Bay Area Critics get together and pick the *best* new play to premiere in the region, and I can't yet put into words how overjoyed I am that my play was selected. I'm still in shock, and tear up when I remember that it happened!

By the way, the first thing my daughter, Audrey, asked me when I told her the amazing news after the call was, "Where's the trophy?" She really really likes trophies.

I will most likely be out April 20th to receive the award at the Theatre Bay Area Conference held at Freight & Salvage in Berkeley, but more about that once travel is figured out. For now, WOW WOW WOW WOOHOO YAY AHHHHHHHHH YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!

AND, for everyone out there thinking that maybe, just maybe, they should bring the *award winning* play *RIPPED* to their theater, YOU ARE CORRECT! You absolutely should!!! [Email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) for a perusal copy of the script or find the latest draft on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped).

And please read [the San Francisco Chronicle article announcing the good news](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/theater/ripped-by-rachel-bublitz-wins-2020-will-glickman-award)! It gives more information about the Glickman Award, which by the way started the year I was born!!!! It feels a little bit like it was meant to be.

Happy Wednesday!!
