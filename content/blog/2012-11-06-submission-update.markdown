title: Submission Update
---

The year is winding down... Looking back to 2011, I made this statement here on my blog:

>"Looking to 2012 I have some goals (not resolutions). I want to complete another full length play and 4 more short or one act plays. I want to make it to 150 submissions, and Iâ€™d like 10 theatres or publishers to use my work. I would also like to read one play a week."

I am close to part of my goal... I have reached 145 submissions for this year! And 8 theatres/organizations so far have used my work. I have a few more weeks, we'll see if I make it! Although, after hearing advice from the lovely [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/) I think I made my goal backwards. I have no control over how many places select me, but I *do* control how many submissions I make. Megan had a goal of receiving 100 rejection letters this year, and I really admire that. This year I've gotten 43 rejection letters (a lot of places just leave you hanging in the wind). I am definitely considering that as my goal for next year.

And I still have some big submissions on the horizon... I'm getting everything ready to apply for my [MFA](http://rachelbublitz.com/blog/2012/10/26/mfa-application/) and there's also [Playwrights' Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/)'s Sheherezade 13! 2013 here I come!
