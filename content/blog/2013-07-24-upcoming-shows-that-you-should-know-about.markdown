###[Just Theater](http://justtheater.org/) presents [A MAZE by Rob Handel](https://jonathan-spector.squarespace.com/a-maze2/), now - August 4th

I am super excited to be seeing this play on Sunday. I have heard SO many great things about it. 

>A dizzying, dazzling, ambitious work, Rob Handel's A MAZE interweaves a teenage girl recreating her identity after eight years held captive in a suburban basement, a pair of rock stars re-inventing themselves after a hit song, and a self-taught artist gaining a cult following for his 15,000-page comic book.

All performances at 8pm Live Oak Theater, 1301 Shattuck Avenue (at Berryman)

###[AGE OF BEAUTY](https://www.facebook.com/events/188414297988519/) by [Stuart Bousel](http://endymionrising.blogspot.com/), August 1st - 17th

I've been lucky to see a few plays written by Stuart Bousel, and because of that I make sure not to miss anything new that's being produced. Here's a bit about the play from the facebook event page:

>The Age of Beauty, written and directed by Stuart Bousel, is a 90 minute one-act play developed from four conversations between four pairs of women.

>In New York, Susan ([Emma Rose Shelton](http://pianofight.com/about/pianofighters/emma-rose-shelton/)) and Regina ([Sylvia Hathaway](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/pint-sized-interview-7-sylvia-hathaway-vs-katja-rivera/)) are re-united for the first time after a decade of not speaking, and over lunch they dance around the possibility of rekindling their friendship. In Oakland, long-distance friends Imogen (Emma Rose Shelton) and Jenny (Sylvia Hathaway) are having lunch during Imogen's visit to the Bay Area following the birth of Jenny's first child and the publication of Imogen's book about their mutual past. On a train between Oakland and New York, Lisa ([Allison Page](http://twitter.com/AllisonLynnPage)) and Deva ([Megan Briggs](http://www.meganbriggs.com/)), who have been attending the same yoga class for the last year, negotiate taking their budding friendship to a deeper level. In separate places, Pauline (Megan Briggs) and Vera (Allison Page) each contemplate the end of their romantic relationship with one another, and how we process a relationship that has run its course.

>Sort of The Heidi Chronicles meets My Dinner With Andre, this quiet comedy is about how we change, how we grow apart, how we grow back together again, and how our perceptions of each other bridge or create the distance between any two people at any given time in our lives.

>Lighting Design by Wil Turner IV. Sound Design by Jim Lively. Art Design by Cody Rishell.

August 1-17, 8 PM, at the Exit Theatre in San Francisco.
