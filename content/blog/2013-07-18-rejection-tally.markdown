title: Rejection Tally
---

Yesterday I had a big submission day... In fact I may have fried my brain. I submitted 11 scripts and I emailed 7 theater companies/producers about an upcoming reading (*Under The Gods' Golden Cleats*, November 9th!!!). Got me thinking about how close I'm getting to my submission goal for the year. As you may remember, I stole this idea from the awesome [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/), she mentioned that a goal of hers was to get 100 rejection letters in a year, and so I took it on as my own.

This year I have made a total of 107 submissions so far. I've had 50 rejections (yay! 1/2 way there!), 46 that I haven't heard back form, and 11 places have decided to use my work. I only have 166 days left in the year, here's to hoping I can make it to 100!
