Great news! The [Egyptian YouTheatre](https://parkcityyoutheatre.com/) is producing the full-length version of [*Biz Town*](https://www.playscripts.com/play/5709) this Fall! I am so thrilled to see my completely ridiculous comedic noir come to life with one of my very favorite theaters.

*Biz Town* will be directed by the incredible Amanda Dayton, and run November 9 - 12, so be sure to mark your calendars! 

And if you'd like to get involved in the production, you're in luck, because you can! [Auditions](https://parkcityyoutheatre.com/offerings/productions/biz-town) are coming up next week, August 29th! If you're in or around Park City, Utah, are are at least in fifth grade, [be sure to check out this page with audition and rehearsal information](https://parkcityyoutheatre.com/offerings/productions/biz-town). Be sure to share with your favorite theater-loving young performers! And as always, you don't have to be on stage to be involved with an Egyptian YouTheatre production, since they have a youth crew as well! You can sign up to be a part of the *Biz Town* tech crew [right here](https://parkcityyoutheatre.com/offerings/classes)!
