Holy cow we opened! [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) at [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow) opened three days ago and my heart is still pounding from the joy and excitement of it all. First of all, THIS PRODUCTION IS 100% FREAKING *AMAZING*. Every piece of it, from the actors, to the direction, the gorgeous transitions, the set, the costumes, the lights, the sound (OH MY GOD, the LIGHTS and SOUND!), the choreography, EVERYTHING IS GREAT AND AMAZING. This production has completely blown my expectations out of the water and I will forever be grateful to the amazing folks at Z Space for taking a chance on me and this play, and putting together such a super star team to bring it to life for the first time.

I am pretty sure I am the happiest playwright in the world right now.

I just uploaded an updated hot-off-the-press draft of *RIPPED* to the New Play Exchange, [check that out here](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped), or [email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) if you'd like a perusal copy.

Finally, COME SEE THIS SHOW! It is a hard play. I'm not gonna lie or sugar coat that. It was hard to write, and I know I ask a lot from all the artists who come to work on it with me. But I also think it's something a lot of folks need to see right now. Come and bask in all that hard work. There's also plenty of space to laugh and feel joy as well. It's got the full range of emotions. So, come on out. Laugh with us. Maybe even cry. Come and let theater move you.

We run through June 15th, buy tickets here: [www.zspace.org/rippedshow](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow).

And when you DO see the show, be sure to tell your friends (or tell folks now if you've already seen it!). This production deserves to be playing to full audiences every single night.
