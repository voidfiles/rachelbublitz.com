Happy September! 

I have returned home after a great weekend soaking up mom-daughter time and collecting mosquito bites in Colorado! Except for the mosquito bites it was quite a great trip.

But August is over, September is here, and we've got business to get to.... #SubmissionMission business that is. And so without further ado.......... August was a pretty darn good month for submissions, it's actually only second to March for the year so far... And that August total of submitted scripts is...........

SIXTY THREE! 

Sixty three scripts sent out on their merry way with kisses and well wishes! Which, brings my total for 2018 up to.................

### 441!!!

I've submitted more this year so far than I've ever submitted in any other year of my whole entire playwright life! AND, I'm technically only *nine* submissions away from my #SubmissionMission for 2018! I think it's time to officially raise the bar, I'm setting it now up to 600 and see if that's a number I learn to regret. Only time and lots of submissions will tell!

Happy Tuesday everyone!
