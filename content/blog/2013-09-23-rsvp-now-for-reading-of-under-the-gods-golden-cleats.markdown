title: RSVP Now For Reading Of UNDER THE GODS' GOLDEN CLEATS
---

NOVEMBER 9th! 8pm at the [Exit Theatre](http://www.theexit.org/) in San Francisco, the [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) presents:

##*Under The Gods' Golden Cleats*
a new play by Rachel Bublitz

The legend of Achilles mashed with Texas football; a world where cheerleaders are slaves and players are encouraged to kill members of the opposing team.

Directed by [Claire Rice](http://claireannrice.blogspot.com/)

Cast TBA

November 9th, 2013 at 8pm

Rachel Bublitz’s play will mash up Achilles’ story in the Trojan War with the football culture of modern day Texas, creating a brand new world where cheerleaders are property, and the Gods preside over the games. Achilles, a young football legend, is the number one ranked player in the country. When the Trojans kidnap their precious bovine mascot, Helen, Achilles chooses to die young and glorious rather than grow old and lose his talents.
