title: Busy Weekend! Recording 31 Plays in 31 Days Podcast and Starting Rehearsals
  for Cat Ladies
---

I'm gearing up for my first rehearsal for [All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/)'s [Woman In Solodarity](http://catladies.brownpapertickets.com/) this morning, and across town my partner in crime, [Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2), will be recording the [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com) podcast. Big things are in happening here in Berkeley! Make sure you keep your eyes out for the podcast, and be sure to buy your tickets soon for Cat Ladies on [brownpapertickets.com](http://catladies.brownpapertickets.com/). 

Okay, that's all for now.
