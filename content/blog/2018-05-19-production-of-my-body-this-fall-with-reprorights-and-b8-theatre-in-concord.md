So happy to announce that [*MY BODY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2541/my-body) will be produced in the Bay Area this October with [ReproRights!](https://www.facebook.com/reprorightsplays/?hc_ref=ARQr2-2-eOhQT9qXjKC-QaseHlKRV22JkgRxDy5Kibshks40tr6-hsSwFfO_ClqcVkk&fref=nf) and [B8 Theatre](http://www.b8theatre.org/)! This has been a BIG year for *MY BODY*, it was a national semi-finalist for the Kennedy Center ACTF National Ten Minute Play Award, and it's been produced with [Artistic Vibes](http://www.artistic-vibes.com/) and [Horatio Productions](https://www.scifitheatre.com/)!
