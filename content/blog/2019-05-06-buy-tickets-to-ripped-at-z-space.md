We are only two weeks and two days away from the WORLD FREAKING PREMIERE of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) at [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/)! My actors and director are working away at rehearsals, my designers are putting together our world, and I'm twiddling my thumbs going slightly insane from anticipation. Not really, but close... I'm around to answer script questions, and I'll be video conferencing into rehearsal this week to go over a scene as in person as I can with everyone, thank you FaceTime. Everyone is working so hard. And I am working at worrying SO hard. Being a playwright is no joke.

All of this to say... Don't let all this work and nerves go to waste!.... Have you purchased tickets for *RIPPED* yet?
