Today is the 300th day of 2014! Which, if you've been keeping track, would mean that I should have submitted 300 plays by now. I'm still a bit behind, but I'm hoping that today is the day I catch back up. So far to date I've submitted 291 scripts, I only need to send out 9 more scripts to catch up! 

It also means that I'm coming up on having only 65 more to go! 65 is such a small number when compared to 365, I'm hoping that the rest of the submissions just fly by. 

Be sure you check back in as the year ends, I will be posting my stats; submission total, acceptances, and rejections from this year, and the number of opportunities I'm still waiting to hear from. 

And now, to get to those submissions....
