title: INVEST IN THE ARTISTS! Give to PlayGround Today
---

[PlayGround](playground-sf.org) is raising money right now in these last few days of their 20th year! From their blog ([http://networkedblogs.com/RYHr0](http://networkedblogs.com/RYHr0)):

>"As we count down twenty days of PlayGround's 20th Season Year-End Campaign, we're pleased to share with you a daily testimonial from PlayGround artists, subscribers and supporters and community leaders. To participate in the Year-End Campaign, make a tax-deductible contribution online at [Causes.com](https://www.causes.com/campaigns/67350-invest-in-the-artists) or on the [PlayGround website](playground-sf.org), or call us at (415) 992-6677."

I've enjoyed reading through the testimonials and I think you will too! And here's the link for your donations: [https://www.causes.com/campaigns/67350-invest-in-the-artists](https://www.causes.com/campaigns/67350-invest-in-the-artists).

Thank you! As one of the artists, we couldn't do it without you!
