title: City Lights Theatre Reading Tonight
---

In case you fell asleep, or forgot, my short play *Horny Like The Wolf* will join 7 other short plays tonight in evening of staged readings in San Jose at [City Lights Theatre](http://cltc.org/footer-opportunities/new-play-series/)! The reading starts at 8pm, and there will be a talk back with the playwrights after. I do hope to see you there tonight!
