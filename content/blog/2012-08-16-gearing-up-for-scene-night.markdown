title: Gearing Up For Scene Night
---

No new plays today. I've been busy gearing up for a road trip (driving to Santa Barbara tomorrow with my kiddos, and from there we're heading down to San Diego on Sunday), and trying to fix up a play for tonight's scene night with PCSF. I'm actually a little nervous. I'm bringing in play #10 from the 31 Plays in 31 Days challenge, it's called *Lily and Eric Are Monsters*. Not only is... Well, it's very different, stylistically than what I normally write in a lot of ways. For one thing it's certainly isn't funny (at least I hope it isn't funny, I haven't written a lot that isn't funny), and it's not dialogue. It goes between like a dueling monologue and straight monologue to other things. I'm very excited by this piece though, and I think that's why I'm so nervous. I'm hoping to shape it up to submit it to BOA in September... I have another one act I've been working on for BOA, *Terrible People* and I have NO idea which one I'll end up submitting. Sigh.
