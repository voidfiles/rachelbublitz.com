The schedule for [Outvisible Theatre Company](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/)’s [2018 Detroit New Works Festival](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/playwriting-opportunities/newworks/) is set! Directors have been selected! Here’s the full festival schedule and lineup:

### Saturday, April 28th

#### 2:30pm: Reading of *RIPPED* by [Rachel Bublitz](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz), directed by [Mycah Artis](http://www.serotoninsyndrome.us/about.php) 

>”Lucy, a freshman in college, is torn between her excitement about the new people in her life and having to leave her old life and loves behind. As she struggles to find a balance between the new and the old, a sexual encounter leaves her confused and concerned that she may have been a victim of rape. The play moves back and forth through time and space as Lucy tries to piece together the unraveling interactions between herself and the two young men she’s torn between, illuminating the events behind her uncertainty and sparking questions regarding consent.”

#### 3:50pm: Talkback of *RIPPED*

#### 4:45pm: Reading of *WOKE* by Avery Sharpe, directed by Casaundra Freeman

>”WOKE is a story that follows two young men who are best friends. Even though one is black and the other is white, they have always lived and loved each other like family. However, after the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castille, they both arduously discover how to navigate their different world viewpoints with justice, patience, and love. Through family, romance, and their own friendship, they painstakingly and comically explore what it truly means to be woke.”

#### 6:40pm: Talkback of *WOKE*

#### 7:30pm: Reading of *NETTLED* by [Kristian O’Hare](http://kristianohare.tumblr.com/bio), directed by Robert Schorr

>”Under the influence of nettle-infused cocktails, two men, celebrating their 10th anniversary, embark on a rousing journey through the city of San Francisco. From foraged haute cuisine to bathhouse poetry to hipster threesomes, these men must confront their true feelings about love and loyalty in a city (and within a culture) that bucks heteronormative culture, by celebrating alternatives to traditional love and commitment.”

#### 9:20pm: Talkback of *NETTLED*

#### Afterglow to follow.

### Sunday, April 29th

#### 2pm: Reading of *THE GROWING STONE* by [Peter Snoad](https://newplayexchange.org/users/1600/peter-snoad), directed by Scott Anthony Joy

>”Matt Barnett harbors a dark family secret from his childhood. Returning home years later when his mother is dying, Matt seeks truth and healing – and finds a future he never expected. A play about love, pain, redemption, loyalty, aboriginal wisdom, and hope in the stars.”

#### 3:45pm: Talkback of *THE GROWING STONE*

#### 4:30pm: Reading of *GIFTED AND TALENTED* by [Sonya Sobieski](https://newplayexchange.org/users/5890/sonya-sobieski), directed by [Sarah Hawkins Moan](https://www.tippingpointtheatre.com/sarah-hawkins-moan/)

>”Middle-class mom Shana is thrilled that her daughter tested into the most prestigious public school in the city… until she joins the PTA. Gifted and Talented is the behind-the-scenes struggle of a public school to survive shrinking government funding–as well as the large personalities of its increasingly indispensable volunteers.”

#### 5:45pm: Talkback of *GIFTED AND TALENTED*

#### Afterglow to follow.

#### Winner announced no later than 7pm on Sunday, April 29th!
