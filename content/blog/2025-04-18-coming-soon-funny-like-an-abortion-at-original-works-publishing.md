It's officially official! *Funny, Like An Abortion* is getting published with [Original Works Publishing](https://www.originalworksonline.com/)! I am thrilled to be able to share this play with the world, and that I'll get to hold it as a beautiful glossy book soon!

*Funny, Like An Abortion* just closed its fifth production last month with [Fat Theatre Project](https://fattheatreproject.com/), and I'm hoping the play will soon be adding productions around the country. I still want to see it done in every state! So far it's received a full production in New Jersey, Ohio, Texas, Indiana, and Illinois. Only 45 to go!

I'm so happy that *Funny, Like An Abortion* found a home with Original Works Publishing, where my play [*Ripped*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/ripped) also lives. Looks like Original Works Publishing is home to all my burn-the-world-down plays.

For those of you familiar with the play, don't fear! The ending, which is changeable as different laws pass, remains that; changeable! I have stage directions for what can change, so each future production will be able to adjust language with my permission.

Stay tuned for when the play is downloadable/purchasable/licensable! I will share that right here, pretty much the instant that it happens. Also, stay tuned for the cover, it is a dangerous amount of fun!
