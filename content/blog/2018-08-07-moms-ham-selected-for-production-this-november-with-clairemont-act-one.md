I got some great news over the weekend: [*MOM'S HAM*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/62099/moms-ham), one of my ten-minute Christmas plays, has been selected for production with [Clairemont Act One](http://clairemontactone.org/) this November! Clairemont Act One selected a total of eight plays, all dealing with love and family, for [Please Pass The Gravy](http://clairemontactone.org/2018/06/calling-all-playwrights/), which will be produced November 16th, 17th, 23rd, and 24th, in the Clairemont neighborhood of San Diego (my hometown!!). So get ready family, this November, one of my plays is coming to you!

This also means that I am only ONE MONTH AWAY from having a public performance of my work in every month of the year. Now I only need December! Come on December! We can do this! If you're a producer/director/theater maker that'd be interested in putting something together for December (or any time really), give me a holler ([Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com)), I am all ears!

Happy Tuesday!
