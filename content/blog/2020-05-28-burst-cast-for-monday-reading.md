I have my first rehearsal for the reading of [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) in [PlayGround](https://playground-sf.org/)'s [Zoom Fest](https://playground-sf.org/zoomfest/) today and I am so excited! I'll be honest... Zoom and I haven't always been seeing eye to eye these past few months, but I am so thrilled to be working on this play despite the plague, AND I get to do so with a phenomenal group of artists. Yes, I would love to be in a physical room with everyone, but I am very happy to at least have this. And so! Let me tell you who my cast is:

Lauren English will play Sarah Boyd  
Karen Offereins will play Jennifer Weaver  
Niery Rojo will play Alexis Lyons  

Of the three I've only had the pleasure of working with Karen Offereins (who is amazing!), and I can't wait to get to know these kick-ass theater artists. Plus, have I told you my director? [Estefanía Fadul](https://www.estefaniafadul.com/) will direct! Estefanía is based in New York City, and has worked at so many cool theaters including the Public Theater, Playwrights' Realm, and Southern Rep! This whole thing is just so exciting! 

Best part? YOU can tune in! From ANYwhere. One of the benefits of being online is that you can be ANYwhere and watch! Here are the nitty-gritty details:
