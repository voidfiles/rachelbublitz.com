title: Images From OY OY OY MERRY CHRISTMAS
---

Remember back in December when my short play *Oy Oy Oy, Merry Christmas!* was produced over in New York by the lovely folks over at [Unity Stage Company](http://unitystage.org/unitystage.org/index.html.html)? Well it happened, and now I have the pictures to prove it! Check it out!!

*If you're reading this on facebook, you'll need to click through to my website to see the images.
