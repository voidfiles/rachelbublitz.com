Last night was a blast! It was great to hear an ending that I felt really great about. AND, even better, after getting notes and hearing things for myself, I know what I'll be attacking for the next draft! This script is such a fun and engaging world to jump into, and with each reading, and after each new draft it starts to feel more and more alive. It's close guys, it's getting very very close!

So keep your eyes pealed! You will hear and see more from me and *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* soon.
