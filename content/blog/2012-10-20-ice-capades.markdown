title: Ice Capades
---

Last night I took both kids to Disney On Ice: 100 Years of Magic. And I will give this to the ice capades... THEY HAD A WHALE ONE STAGE! Oh yes. 

They also captivated my kids, which is a slight miracle. Although it must be said that they do a horrible job of mashing up scenes from their own movies. They should hire me, I'm awesome at that. I adapted ALICE IN WONDERLAND in high school for our drama department from five or six different versions and it was awesome.
