title: BABIES Wins TWO Awards Including BEST OF FRINGE
---

[All Terrain Theatre](http://www.allterraintheater.org/)'show in [SF Fringe](http://www.sffringe.org/), Babies, the Ultimate Birth Control: Terrifyingly Hilarious Plays about Parenting, a show that I wrote 1/2 of, won TWO awards last night! We won BEST OF FRINGE and one SOLD OUT award! I am proud to have worked on this show, and I'm SO grateful to our cast, director, stage manager, producer, and my partner in crime ([Tracy Held Potter](https://www.facebook.com/TracyHeldPotter)) for making this show so wonderful! 

ALSO, thank you to all those folks who made it out and got to see the hilarious show! There are more shows coming up, as usual, and I have some exciting things to announce soon too!
