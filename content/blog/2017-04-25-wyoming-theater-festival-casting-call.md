##ATTENTION SALT LAKE ACTORS: [Wyoming Theater Festival](http://www.whitneyarts.org/about-us/wyoming-theater-festival/) is looking for YOU!

###CASTING CALL:

The Wyoming Theater Festival is seeking actors for a development production of [Kenneth Jones](http://www.bykennethjones.com/)’s new play, “Hollywood, Nebraska,” directed by Scott Alan Evans, artistic director of off-Broadway’s The Actors Company Theater (TACT). Jones’s play “Alabama Story” premiered at Pioneer Theater Company in 2015 and will have had productions in 10 cities by the spring of 2018. “Hollywood, Nebraska” is his latest play.
2 Equity contracts and 4 non-Equity contracts are available. Housing is provided for all actors. Rehearsals begin Aug. 21 and the show closes Sept. 17. Please send your headshot/resume to [dhodnett@sheridan.edu](mailto:dhodnett@sheridan.edu) by Friday, May 5th for consideration.

“*Hollywood, Nebraska*” takes place in the panhandle of Nebraska, where two actresses of a certain age are making a homecoming in their small town. Jane’s in from L.A. to check up on her ailing mother. Andrea’s back from New York to bury her father. A romantic, rueful new comedy about the urge to be creative, the itch to move away and the ache of reconnecting with the family and feelings that you left behind.

Located in beautiful Sheridan, WY, the Wyoming Theater Festival is dedicated to launching new plays and musicals as well as retooling worthy neglected works.

###“*HOLLYWOOD, NEBRASKA*” CASTING BREAKDOWN

JANE, 40s. An attractive, talented L.A.-based actress, twice-divorced and ready for reinvention. Tough exterior, defensive about where she is in her career but has a cool, laid back, independent confidence. The sort of person who is used to being right.

ALMA, 70s. Mother of Jane. Small-town widow. Not worldly, perhaps even narrow. Everybody’s “mom” figure. Beneath her homespun wisdom and her passion for local tradition is a bitterness about how life turned out.

ROBERT, early 50s. A widower, a carpenter/contractor native to Nebraska. Latino, Hispanic, Native American encouraged to reflect that community’s ties to this part of rural America. Salt of the earth. An idealized “regular guy” — a veteran, a great dad, entrepreneurial/self-employed and optimistic. Can flirt but when exposed can be taciturn.

KATIE, 15-16 years old, in high school. All ethnicities encouraged. Robert’s daughter, who wants to be an actress one day. Optimistic. Eager to learn. The kind of kid you want to have as your daughter.

ANDREA, 40s. A New York actress clinging to the illusion that she is/was a successful actress. No edit button. Delicious, beautiful, dark-humored and unlike anyone in this small-town. A creature whose well of sadness/disappointment is deep. Ideally, an actress with piano/singing skill but not a must.

LANCE, 30s, can look younger. Latino, Hispanic, Native American encouraged to reflect that community’s ties to this part of rural America. Salt of the earth worker-bee. Not worldly, not deep. A catch without knowing it. A survivor. Hides a hidden artistic talent. Ideally, an actor with piano skill but not a must.
