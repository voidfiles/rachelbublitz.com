I moved to San Francisco in 2005 with my soon-to-be husband. We moved into a studio apartment at 6th and Taylor, next to the Golden Gate Theatre. My second job in the city (I had a brief stint at the Old Navy on Market), the one that I kept for the remainder of my undergrad, was at [City Box Office](https://www.cityboxoffice.com/default.asp). I'd applied for the job hoping to get connected to more theater people, and while that didn't so much work out, I did meet some of my favorite people on the planet, and got the chance to see a ton of events that I wouldn't have been able to afford any other way. City Box Office has an exclusive contract with the Herbst Theatre. This is how I saw Salmon Rushdie, Zadie Smith, Kiki and Herb, Amy Sedaris, and so so so many others. The Herbst is where I had a small moment saying hello to Robin Williams, where I completely embarrassed myself in front of Molly Ringwald, where I told Richard Brautigan's daughter how influential her father was to me. In a lot of ways the Herbst feels like my first San Francisco home.

November 4th I am returning to the Herbst for the Theatre Bay Area Awards where, (insert drum roll please) [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/)'s world premiere production of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) has been named a finalist for a whopping SEVEN awards!!!! Including....

* Outstanding Sound Design: Sara Huddleston
* Outstanding Lighting Design: Colm McNally
* Outstanding Creative Specialty, Movement and Staging/Intimacy Director: Maya Herbsman
* Outstanding Direction of a Play: Lisa Steindler
* Outstanding Performance in a Principal Role in a Play: Krystle Piamonte (Lucy)
* Outstanding World Premiere Play: ME! Ahhhhhh!
* Outstanding Production of a Play: Z Space Team

I am surprised. I am honored. I am so over-the-moon that the efforts of these fantastic artists are being recognized. And I am feeling a very full-circle moment that on November 4th I'll be heading to the Herbst Theatre in San Francisco for the Award Show.

Find out about tickets, and the full list of finalists [here](https://www.theatrebayarea.org/page/AwardsCelebration). And maybe see you in November?
