![Collage of playwriting highlights from 2024.](/images/playwriting_2024.jpg)

2024 is winding down, with only a week and a half left I'd like to look back over the year and share my playwriting highlights! So let's get to it!!

#### Top left:  
[*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2017091/funny-like-an-abortion) had its second production of its [National New Play Network](https://nnpn.org/) Rolling World Premiere with [Cleveland Public Theatre](https://www.cptonline.org/), directed by [Paige Conway](https://www.paigeconway.com/). I got to go to Cleveland *twice*, explore the city and see all the hard working artists put their hearts into my play. It was a beautiful, sparky, devastating production, and I learned from Paige how life-changing a trampoline coffee table can be.

[*Burst*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/burst) received its second production with [Relative Theatrics](https://www.relativetheatrics.com/) in Laramie, Wyoming!

#### Top middle-right:  
[*Codename: White Mouse*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/1995021/codename-white-mouse) received its world premiere with [Lind Lane](https://www.lindlane.com.au/) in Australia! The play tells the amazing story of Nancy Wake, a spy during World War II. Nancy Wake was played by Michelle Connelly.

New publication! [*The Summer I Howled*](https://www.youthplays.com/play/the-summer-i-howled-by-rachel-bublitz-690), my summer camp monster comedy, found a home with [YouthPLAYS](https://www.youthplays.com/). Give it a read, it's a hoot and it has super flexible casting.

#### Middle right:  
[*The Book Women*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/the-book-women) received a gorgeous production with [Fredonia University](https://www.fredonia.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-liberal-arts-sciences/theatre-dance), directed by [Daniel Lendzian](https://www.danlendzian.com/). The put horse heads on bookcases, which was absolutely brilliant. I've had the pleasure of working with Daniel before, he directed the world premiere of *Burst* a few years ago. It was a joy to have my words in his hands again, and I hope we get another opportunity to collaborate in the future!

Another world premiere! [*Red Days*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2010250/red-days) received a world premiere with [Adjusted Realists](https://www.adjustedrealists.com/) in New York City! They took so much care with this production, I was thrilled to see this play fully get up on its feet!

#### Bottom left:  
A brand new play! I was commissioned by [Alexandra Harbold](https://www.alexandraharbold.com/) and the [University of Utah](https://www.theatre.utah.edu/) to write a sports play! And not just any kind of sports play, a water polo sports play! Water polo is not the easiest sport to stage, but I had a ton of fun giving it a go, especially with Alexandra and her movement wizardry to support my text. The play had a workshop and reading this past Fall, and we're hoping for big things in the future! Read the play on the New Play Exchange: [*Hear Us Roar*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/3193750/hear-us-roar).

#### Bottom middle-left:  
[*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/2017091/funny-like-an-abortion) had its final production in its NNPN Roll with [The VORTEX](https://vortexrep.org/) in Austin, Texas. I was able to join early rehearsals, as well as opening, and again, I was blown away. It's incredible to have so many artists throw their hearts into your work, and that was what I received from this Rolling World Premiere. Balls to the wall energy, heart, laughter, and passion. Huge thank you to director [Bonnie Cullum](https://vortexrep.org/staff), and all the artists. It was such a special production!

#### Bottom middle-right:  
This year, [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches) reached and surpassed [50 productions](https://rachelbublitz.com/2024/12/11/over-fifty-productions-for-the-night-witches-worldwide/) world-wide! With a lot more productions in the pipe-line, I can't wait to see when this play will hit 100. With it be in 2025? It just might!

#### Bottom right:  
And finally, another publication! [*Burst*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/burst) is now available to purchase and license through [Dramatic Publishing](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/)! I am thrilled to have another title with Dramatic Publishing! I know *Burst* is in good hands, and can't wait to see where it picks up productions.

Thank you 2024, it's been a year!
