Adding on to the submitting, writing, rewriting, rehearsing, and teaching, I also am at my kids’ swim practice a *lot*. It’s pretty boring stuff, which makes me thankful that the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) exists. While my children lap the pool, I get to read and recommend amazing new plays, basically we’re all winning. 

During the month of September, here are the plays I got around to reading and recommending:
