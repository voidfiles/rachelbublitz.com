title: 9th Play Submitted
---

Catching up, slowly but surely...

I submitted MY BODY as a comedic political writing sample to [Thistle Dew Theatre](http://www.thistle-dew.net/) in Sacramento. They're looking to put together a team of playwrights. Send them up to 3 10-20 minute plays (all political and comedic) with your resume by October 30th if you're interested in working with them.
