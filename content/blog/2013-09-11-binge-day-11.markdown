I have submitted TWENTY FOUR scripts so far. That means I only have SIX more to go to complete this month's [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/playwrightbinge/info). Completion is so close, I can almost taste it...

[T. Schreiber Studio](http://tschreiber.org/productions/new-works-project/) seeks full length plays for their New Works Project. Send them a treatment of your play, five pages of sample dialogue, your bio, and your resume. I sent them information and a sample of *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats*, and this was submission #14. Deadline for phase one is 12/1/13.

Number 15 was my ten-minute play *Mother Of The Year*, I sent it over to [Sticky](http://tschreiber.org/productions/new-works-project/) in New York City. They want ten-minute plays that take place in a bar. Deadline is 11/1/13.

My 16th submission was to my school (San Francisco State University). I handed over *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* to be considered for the Jim Highsmith Playwriting Award. The play can be of any length and on a theme of Gay or Lesbian experience. You must be a student to submit for this one and the deadline is 9/23/13.

Also at my school, I submitted *Rainbow The Clown*, *Bears At Midnight*, and *Self Defense* to the SFSU Lit Magazine [Transfer](http://www.sfsu.edu/~transfer/). This you must also be a student for. If you're keeping count that took care of submissions 17, 18, and 19.

For my 20th submission I sent [Libra Theater Company](http://www.libratheater.org/) *The Fantasy Club*. They're looking for full-length plays with four characters, that can all be played by 20-somethings. Bonus if your play could have original music or songs built into it. The deadline on this is 9/30/13.

Finally, I sent four plays over to [Smith & Kraus](http://www.smithandkraus.com/htdocs/index.php) for publication: *They Fantasy Club*, *Nap Time*, *Good-Good Meal*, and *Baby Shower Games*. They want plays that have been produced between May 1, 2013 - April 30, 2014. Email those to [Lawrence Harbison](mailto:lharbison1@nyc.rr.com).

So that brings me up to 24! Lots of more fun places to send things to, stay tuned for more submission opportunities!
