title: 'Help Us Hit 4k By End Of Day Tomorrow! #thefantasyclub'
---

We have to raise $1,673 to raise to hit our base goal, and wouldn't it be just *fabulous* if we hit that tomorrow? I think so. Remember our base goal of $4,000 only covers basic costs, and we'll still need to sell advertising and sell out each show to break even. We would ideally like to raise more. And so many of you have already given, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You are helping the independent theatre community here in San Francisco, and that is wonderful. We now need you to go out and tell your friends. Tell your friend's friends. Tell the world. Why? So glad you asked.......

Here are the *extra* things that each one of you who donated will get when we hit our stretch goals:

$5,000 

If we raise at least $5,000, then everyone who has contributed $25 or more to the campaign will receive a pair of *The Fantasy Club* condoms! 

$7,500 

If we raise at least $7,500, then everyone who has contributed $50 or more to the campaign will receive a CUSTOM sexy thank you message recorded by Barb, the phone sex operator, sent to your email as an MP3. 

$10,000 

If we raise at least $10,000, then everyone who has contributed $75 or more to the campaign will receive CUSTOM erotic messages from Barbâ€™s Twitter account. 

I don't know about you, but I *want* an erotic message from Barb. SO! Share the [kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz) with your buds, use #thefantasyclub, if you're tweeting us up (I will retweet and favorite any and all tweets with that hashtag!). 

We also have more hilarious things to share with you, and as we raise more we will share more. So get on it!

And, as always, a huge and heartfelt thank you to our generous donors yesterday; Ann and Matt Eisenberg. You two are super stars!

And one more time, because I like you *that* much, here's the kickstarter link: [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz)
