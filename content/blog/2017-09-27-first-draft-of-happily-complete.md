Holy crap! I did it! Somehow I managed to pull enough words out of my insides to complete me FOURTH full-length play of the year, *HAPPILY*. Two more to go folks, two more to go!

Now I send off this messy and confusing draft to the patient and wonderful folks at [Quantum Dragon](https://www.quantumdragon.org/) and they put together a table read and eventually a staged reading for either the end of the year or early next year. Woo! I'm not sure writing "end of play" has ever felt so good, but that's probably not true, I'm sure it feels this good each and every time. Stay tuned for dates and more information for Quantum Dragon's [The Forge](https://www.quantumdragon.org/copy-of-the-forge-2016) reading series, that will be coming soon.

For now, cookies! Thank goodness the Halloween Jo-Jo's are back.
