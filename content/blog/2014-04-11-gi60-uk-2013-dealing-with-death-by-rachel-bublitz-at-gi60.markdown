Last summer, [Gi60](http://gi60.blogspot.com/) produced a one-minute play that I had written, making me an internationally produced playwright! And now here is proof!

Thank you Gi60 for posting videos! I can't wait to see this year's plays!

Also, if you're on facebook and want to watch the video, you'll have to click through to my website.

Enjoy!
