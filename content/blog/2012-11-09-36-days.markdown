That's how long I have to get everything together for my MFA Application. Oy. I still need unofficial and official transcripts from my junior college down in San Diego (you have to request them *in person!*), thankfully I'm leaving next week to visit family so it's not a big deal... I need to get my CSU application in, pay the fee, finish up my statement of purpose, and finally... Delivery all of it to SFSU! I'll get it all done. I just hate having to wait. 

In other news, last night's scene night at [Play Cafe](http://www.playcafe.org/) was a lot of fun. I brought in a ten minute play that I wrote for [The 31 Plays in 13 Days Project](http://31plays31days.com/)... Mostly to see if it was something worth submitting, and I found out that yes indeed it was. I got a lot of laughs, and there's nothing better than that (unless of course you're writing a drama).

Well, back to my studies... I've got a stack of books to get through. Enjoy the weekend!
