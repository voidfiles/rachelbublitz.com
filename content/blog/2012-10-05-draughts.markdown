It's not writer's block... It's motivation block really. This whole week I've not felt like tearing it up like my normal self. Maybe I burnt myself out a bit with [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31play31days.com) followed by my super busy September... Maybe I have a cold. Maybe it's all of the above. I'm lame this week. I couldn't even play hooky from scene night correctly (check out last night's posts about *not* getting in to see ASSASSINS). 

But you know what? I'm okay with it. I'll jump back in, don't you worry your pretty little head. Soon too. I'm enjoying not thinking at the moment, but come Monday morning and it's back to work I go.

Stay tuned.
