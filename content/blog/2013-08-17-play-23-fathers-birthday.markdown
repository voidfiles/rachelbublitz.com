---

Moving back in time folks. Today I'm presenting you with my 23rd play in the [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/) challenge, it's called *Father's Birthday*. Enjoy!

###*Father's Birthday* a short play by Rachel Bublitz

Characters:

Father, m, 35-50, any race.

Mother, f, 35-50, any race.

Daughter, f, 15-18, any race.

Son, m, 10-14, any race.

Setting:

A dining room.

*A dinning room. FATHER, MOTHER, DAUGHTER, and SON all sit down for dinner.*

DAUGHTER
Dinner is delicious!

SON
Sure is!

FATHER
Thanks kids! I love providing healthy and nutritious meals for my family!

MOTHER
Would you mind grabbing some salt for me, dear?

FATHER
Salt?

MOTHER
Yeah.

FATHER
Salt isn’t healthy!

MOTHER
Well this needs something.

*FATHER stands.*

FATHER
Why don’t you tell me how you really feel?

*FATHER takes everyone’s plates, piles them onto the main dish in the middle, picks it all up and exits with the dishes.*

SON
Nice going, mom.

DAUGHTER
Yeah, real sensitive.

MOTHER
I’m sick of eating this crap, okay?

*We hear a loud crash. SON exits after FATHER, after a moment, SON enters.*

SON
Dad through everything on the floor.

MOTHER
Again?

DAUGHTER
Should have kept your mouth shut.

MOTHER
I just asked for a little salt. IS THAT SO WRONG?

*FATHER enters.*

FATHER
Farewell children, I am leaving the house.

SON
Come on, dad.

FATHER
It’s true this time. I’m leaving FOREVER!

*FATHER moves to exit. MOTHER blocks his way.*

MOTHER
Babe, sit down.

FATHER
I’m sick of you undermining me! I want to go where I’m appreciated, where I’m loved.

DAUGHTER
I love you daddy!

FATHER
You don’t count!

MOTHER
Now you need to relax. I love you.

FATHER
Prove it.

MOTHER
I was going to wait until after dinner.... But...

FATHER
What? Did you get me something? Did you? Did you? Did you? Did you?

MOTHER
Check the kitchen.

*FATHER exits. A moment later FATHER enters with a small wrapped present.*

FATHER
Oh, I thought you had forgotten my birthday!

MOTHER
I wanted it to be a surprise. Go on, open it!

*FATHER opens the present, it is a pearl necklace.*

FATHER
PEARLS?

MOTHER
You like them?

FATHER
They’re magnificent! Come here son, help me get this on!

*SON goes to FATHER, and puts the necklace on HIM.*

DAUGHTER
They look great.

SON
Beautiful!

MOTHER
Happy birthday!

FATHER
I don’t know what to say! 

*FATHER starts to cry.*

SON
I sure hope I find a lady willing to put up with all my mood swings when I grow up!

FATHER
You will son, if you’re lucky like me.

*FATHER, SON, DAUGHTER, and MOTHER embrace.*

FATHER (CONTINUED)
Now who wants a pizza?

*End of play.*
