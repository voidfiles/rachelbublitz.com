title: Day 3, Play 4

Yesterday my fellow co-founder of [31 Play/31 Days](http://31plays31days.com) Tracy posted this awesome blog about how you could still develop a full length within the confines of our challenge (that can be found [here](http://31plays31days.com/blog/2012/08/02/why-were-writing-31-short-plays-and-how-you-can-still-write-a-full-length/)). It really got me thinking. I wrote a short play a few months back called "Nap Time" and I decided to add on to it... I'm going to try and write some other plays in the same vein and piece them together. I think I'll call it "Things We Can't Say Out Loud" and I am SUPER excited about it. As you can guess from the title it's about the things that we can't say to one another. My forth play for the challenge that I just got in (hell yes!) is called "Horny Like The Wolf." It's a bit too lewd to post here, but I'll email it out if anyone is curious about reading it. It's a beautiful thing to be a part of this artist community all pumping out new work. It is inspiring. Thank you to all of you out there who are participating. You're making this awfully fun!
