title: Semi-Finalist for Sonoma Stage Works' PlayFest 2013
---

I just received an exciting email, my play *Horny Like The Wolf* (which is getting a staged reading at [City Lights Theatre](http://cltc.org/footer-opportunities/new-play-series/) this Tuesday) will also be getting a staged reading in June with [Sonoma Stage Works](http://www.sonomastageworks.org/index.html)! It has been selected as a semi-finalist in their PlayFest 2013 short-play competition. 

The readings will be at 2pm on June 2nd! The audience will then vote, and the top plays will receive a full production in September! More details to come!
