title: OF SERPENTS & SEA SPRAY Coming To New York City Monday August 3rd
---

Coming up in a week, I'll be on the opposite side of the country to present a reading of my play OF SERPENTS & SEA SPRAY in New York City! I can't believe it's come up so quick, and all week I'll be working my little fingers to the bone getting the script in tip-top shape.

Are you in New York? You should come to the reading!! It's going to be a great time, my brilliant director, Ariel Craft, is coming out as well, to direct the reading and she's put together a fantastic cast. The reading is a part of [Custom Made Theatre Co.](http://www.custommade.org/)'s New York Reading Series.

The reading will be at [Ryan's Daughter](http://ryansdaughternyc.com/), a bar located at: 3[50 E 85th St, New York, NY 10028](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ryan's+Daughter/@40.7762808,-73.9504447,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xef06a935384ed972) on Monday (a week from today, AH!), August 3rd at 8pm.

Will you join me? There are so many New York friends I would love to meet in person! Email me if you have any questions, and hope to see you soon!
