[*Of Serpents & Sea Spray*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/products/of-serpents-sea-spray) is getting published with [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/)! Wooooooooooooooooooo! *Of Serpents & Sea Spray* was commissioned by Brian Katz, artistic director of [Custom Made Theatre](https://www.custommade.org/), and received its world premiere there in 2016, directed by the incredible [Ariel Craft](https://cuttingball.com/about-us/people).

*Of Serpents & Sea Spray* received a second production in 2017 with This Is Water Theatre, directed by the awesome [Andrew Roblyer](http://www.andrewroblyer.com/)! This play had such great first productions, and has had a lot of interest ever since for productions at high school. It may be my number one requested script on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/19156/serpents-sea-spray)!

As I've been working hard on getting a lot of new plays published, it came to me that I can look to my back log as well, and I'm so glad I did! I am tweaking the version that goes to print, taking some excellent dramaturgical notes from the folks at Stage Partners. Which means the play with have a brand new version very soon!

Who's excited? (Hint: it's me! I am very excited!) If you, like me, are *very* excited, [head on over and sign up for an email notification when *Of Serpents & Sea Spray* becomes available](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/products/of-serpents-sea-spray).

Happy Friday!
