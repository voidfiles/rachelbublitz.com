This week I'm inviting you to have your own Christmas-in-July moment by reading my collection of eclectic holiday plays: [*Holly, Jolly, & Extra Folly*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/holly-jolly-extra-folly)! This collection has something for everyone, with comedic plays, heart-warming plays, and even a horror play thrown in for funsies. Available with [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/), where you can read these plays for free (!), you're able to license just one, a handful, or the entire collection! Need more reasons to give these plays a read? Glad you asked!

#### Looking for some new holiday fun?

Don't get me wrong, I love the classics, but sometimes it's exciting to tell stories that audiences don't walk in already knowing the endings of. Bonus, these plays, though all short, are filled to the brim with laughter, heart, and yes, one is stuffed with a haunting. You really can't get more classic than a ghost Christmas story... I mean just look at *A Christmas Carol*!

#### Looking for plays for student directors?

Giving eager student directors a ten-minute play to jump into is a great way to give them space to explore without overwhelming them. And with casts ranging from 2 to 7, there's lots of options for directors to bite off what they're ready to chew.

#### Looking for some festive flexibility?

Don't know if you can tell yet, but I'm a huge fan of flexibility, and this collection pretty much has flexibility to the max. For casts, you can have as few as 7 (very busy) actors, or as many as 31! You get to decide how much you want your actors to double up, or if you'd prefer to have a large and in charge cast of over 30! And not only is the cast incredibly flexible, the length ranges between ten  and ninety minutes, depending on how many of these plays you decide to produce. Pick your favorite to produce and join other departments at your school displaying holiday spirit, or pick half of them if you don't want an entire evening of plays.

#### Looking for a collection that offers a wide range of characters for actors to jump into?

As stated, this is an *eclectic* collection of holiday centered plays, with a lot of comedic options, a few characters on the dramatic side, and an entire play of characters being haunted, giving lots and lots of fun options in who your students could be on stage. Right off the bat, if you do the full collection you'd have three wildly different Santas to cast, plus a ghost, Mrs. Claus, Krampus, a whole load of elves, and five reindeer!

Here's a bit ,ore about *Holly, Jolly, & Extra Folly*, including all the play titles in the collection:
