title: Women in Solodarity
---

There's a show coming up at the end of this month that you should know about! Here's all the info:

Women in Solodarity: It's a Woman's World is All Terrain Theater's first showcase dedicated to presenting the work of female Bay Area writers and performers. Recent studies have indicated that although women make up half of the population and about 50% of playwrights, only 20% of productions are written by women. Women in Solodarity is an attempt to challenge these, and similar, statistics by giving voice to women's stories in a fun environment.

The Women in Solodarity project is a reminder that although women may feel isolated, they are still connected by experiences that many women struggle with and find inspiration from. The "solodarity" is an expression of being there for each other even when we are apart. The most political action we are taking with this project is standing up and saying that we want to hear women tell their own stories. In this political and social climate, that is surprisingly revolutionary. 

This spring's Women in Solodarity showcase features stories ranging from early pregnancy to aging (and a lot of life in-between!) using song, humor, and perspective to share these experiences.

Directed by Dalia Haire
Written & Performed by: Sally Holzman, Joy Lian, Lisa-Marie Newton*, Claressa Darden Morrow, and Tracy Held Potter

* Congratulations to Lisa-Marie for winning the 2012 Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle award for Best Actress in a Featured Role!

PERFORMANCES
Women in Solodarity will be performed April 27, 28, and 29 at a private residence in central Berkeley in association with the International Home Theater Festival, a festival dedicated to empowering artists and making theater accessible the community, regardless of economic status.

Please note that the home that we are performing in is located in Central Berkeley. People with severe allergies should note that two cats and a dog reside in this home. The pets will not have access to the room during the performance and we will, of course, clean the space thoroughly before the show. In addition, while the performance space is wheelchair accessible, the restroom is upstairs. The specific address will be provided when reservations are made.

In the spirit of the festival, nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. Please email info@allterraintheater.org to reserve a discounted or free ticket.

The run-time for this show is approximately 80 minutes.
