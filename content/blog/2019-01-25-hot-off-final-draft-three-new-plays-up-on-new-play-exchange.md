I've been a very busy playwright, getting new drafts done left and right. In the past few weeks I've revised THREE new plays, and all are ready for public consumption on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard)! Here's what's new:

### [*Burst*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst), full length

>Sarah Boyd is an extraordinary human being. Not only did she build her company from scratch using nothing but willpower and fortitude, she also sits on the precipice of truly saving this planet. Because on top of being one of the fastest growing tech companies in history, Tactix, with Sarah at its helm, will usher this planet into the post-plastic era. A time where we need not worry or fret over the great destruction being done to our world from this non-biodegradable foe. With her eyes steady on her next round of funding, Sarah must persevere through a late night interview with a particularly tough reporter, a lawsuit aimed at a person from her past, and the waffling of her CTO. It's a heavy load, and Sarah knows that she is the only one great enough to bear it.

### [*Presenting: Super Cat & Reptile Robot in The Tremendous Tickle Trouble*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232233/presenting-super-cat-reptile-robot-terrible-tickle-trouble), TYA one act

>On the brink of the most wonderful/awesome/amazing sleep-over in recorded history two friends grapple with who gets to call the shots and how to tell someone tickling just isn't your thing.

*PRESENTING: SUPER CAT & REPTILE ROBOT IN THE TREMENDOUS TICKLE TROUBLE* will be produced in [Plan-B Theatre](https://planbtheatre.org/)'s 2020 season as the elementary school touring show.

### [*Red Days*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232234/red-days), full length

>As the air quality in Salt Lake climbs to crisis levels, we follow Dianna through four seasons, trying to balance school, her running team, and pursuing her passion. But as she nears the end of her senior year, she's forced to decide if her running dream truly belongs to her, or if it's more her mother's, while around her the serious effects of the air quality wreak havoc on those athletes who dare breath hard in the open air.

*RED DAYS* will receive a workshop and a staged reading next month in Eugene Oregon in the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival Region 7 Conference.
