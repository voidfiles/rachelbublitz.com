I took a vacation from writing and posting, but I'm back and ready to fire it up again! I have a lot coming up in the next few months:

1. [24 Play Festival with Playwright's Center September 15th](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/267511)

2. Play Cafe's Benefit Showcase September 23rd

3. Developmental Reading of MY SISTER'S BABY October 1st

4. [Repro Rights with PCSF October 22nd](http://pitchengine.com/reprorights/repro-rights-evening-of-short-play-readings-to-benefit-planned-parenthood)

Super busy, super exciting! 31 Plays/31 Days is ending in just a few days, and I'll have lots of exciting announcements to make on that front soon. Please stay tuned!
