title: Pint Sized Plays III with the San Francisco Theater Pub
---

The beautiful thing about theatre (and life really) is that one night you're seeing a play that utterly disappoints you, and the next you're seeing work that has you jumping for joy. Last night I went to [Cafe Royale](http://www.caferoyale-sf.com/) to see the [San Francisco Theater Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/)'s [Pint Sized Plays III](https://www.facebook.com/events/147725662029027/). It was fan-freakin'-tastic. You must go and see Pint Sized Plays III. It was en extremely fun night of theatre. My favorite piece (hard to pick one) was [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/)'s play "BEEEEEAAR!". People were practically rolling on the floor, unable to control themselves, they were so over taken by laughter. Allison Page, *the* beer drinking bear, gave a hilarious performance, she was so good, that I want to try and see everything that she ever does in the future... For ever.

[Stuart Bousel](http://dramalist.com/people/2774/stuart-bousel/author/director/actor) is another one I plan on stalking, so far I haven't been to something that he's involved with that has disappointed me. I think he has a gift in making theatre more accessible and appealing to a larger audience. 

SO, to sum things up... Last night was a total blast. If you enjoy having fun, go see the show. It is not to be missed. You can click on the link above for details, and here are the remaining dates:
