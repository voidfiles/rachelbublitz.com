I am so, SO, *SO* excited! My play *Mom's Ham* was selected for [PlayGround](http://playground-sf.org/index.php)'s [(Twisted) Holiday Extravaganza](http://playground-sf.org/boxoffice/)! I can't wait to see my work preformed at Berkeley Rep, and I do hope that you'll join me!

The show starts at 8pm, and is *this* Monday, December 16th, and the address at Berkeley Rep is [2025 Addison Street in Berkeley](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=2025+Addison+Street,+Berkeley&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x80857e9e96d62245:0x7627c756196608a7,2025+Addison+St,+Berkeley,+CA+94704&gl=us&ei=c8WrUvfGC4HioASJyIDQDQ&ved=0CCwQ8gEwAA).
