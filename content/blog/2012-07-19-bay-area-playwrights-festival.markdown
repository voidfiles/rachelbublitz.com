---

As I said yesterday, I won two flex passes to the [Bay Area Playwright's Festival](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=263) put on by the [Playwright's Foundation](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/) and I am pumped! Here are the readings I'm going to this coming weekend:

[GROUNDED by George Brant](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=268) tomorrow, (July 20th) at 8pm.

[BRAHMAN/I: A One-Hijra Stand-Up Comedy Show, by Aditi Brennan Kapil](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=272) on Saturday (July 21st) at 4pm.

and...

[THE HUNDRED FLOWERS PROJECT by Christopher Chen](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=267) on Sunday (July 22nd) at 12pm.

Interested in any of these? I have two passes and I need dates! Email me.
