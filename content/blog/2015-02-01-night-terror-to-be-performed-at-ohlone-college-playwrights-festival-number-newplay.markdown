Happy Sunday!

I just got word that my ten-minute play *Night Terror*, will be performed with Ohlone College's Playwrights Festival this May! May 7th and 8th to be exact. Ohlone College is just down in Fremont, and so I'll be able to actually see this play performed, which is always a plus.

More details as it gets closer, so stay tuned!
