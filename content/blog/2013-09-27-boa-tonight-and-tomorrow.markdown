title: BOA Tonight And Tomorrow
---

What are you up to this weekend? I'm excited because I'm seeing the [Bay Area One Acts](https://www.facebook.com/events/583435088379569/) tonight and tomorrow! In fact, I'll be slinging concessions, so come by and buy something from me! 

Last year I was blown away by the show I saw, and I just know that this year will do the same. The shows are at 8pm and both are at the [Tides Theatre](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=Tides+Theatre&fb=1&gl=us&hq=tides+theatre&cid=0,0,18206329889365693983&ei=AqdFUuzqLqW5igLasIDgBQ&ved=0CJIBEPwSMA0).
