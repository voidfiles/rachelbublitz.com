title: 'Time To Give To The 2015 SF Olympians Festival @SFOlympians #sfolympians'
---

Where have you been? It's been weeks! I've been swamped with road trips, summer school, and dental surgery, but the good news is that I'm back now!

And good thing because TODAY kicks off fundraising for the 2015 [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/)! We need your help to keep this fantastic festival alive. Go to the [Indiegogo Campaign Page](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/san-francisco-olympians-festival-v-monsters-ball#home) ([https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/san-francisco-olympians-festival-v-monsters-ball#home](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/san-francisco-olympians-festival-v-monsters-ball#home)), watch the video and give today! We're raising money throughout the month of July.

If you aren't convinced yet, let me give you TWO reasons why you should give:

1. The SF Olympians Festival commissions new play each year giving writers the opportunity to create brand new pieces from the ground up, most festivals want you to have a play already written before you can submit, that's one of the many reasons this festival is so special. 
2. It also gives many different types of artists the space to collaborate, we are a festival of writers, directors, actors, and fine artists, coming together for three weeks of reading new plays.

There are plenty more reasons to give, PLENTY! Check back all month for more reasons, as we chug along to our goal. And remember to tell your friends to give too!
