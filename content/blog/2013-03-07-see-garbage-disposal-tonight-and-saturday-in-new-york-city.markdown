In New York City? Near New York City? If you answered yes ti either or both questions you should see my short play *Garbage Disposal*!

[Thespian Productions](http://www.thespianproduction.com/) will be producing my ten minute play *Garbage Disposal* for their spring Theatre Madness event at [Joria Main Stage Theatre](https://www.google.com/search?q=260+West+36th+St.%2C+3rd+floor%2C+New+York%2C+NY%2C+10018&oq=260+West+36th+St.%2C+3rd+floor%2C+New+York%2C+NY%2C+10018&aqs=chrome.0.57.323&sugexp=chrome,mod=13&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

March 7th and 9th at 8pm.

If you are able to make it, let me know what you think! Sadly I'll be missing this production.
