+++

The time has come to share my bad news, the Owl and Cat Theatre's developmental run of production of *RIPPED*, which was supposed to open this past Wednesday, was canceled. I don't totally know what happened, being so far away, but it sounds like a lot... They lost their space, and the artistic director, who was directing my play, was removed as artistic director. The new artistic director let me know that she and the cast are still very interested in putting the show up on its feet, but it's all very much up in the air. It was a bit of a blow last week, but I tackled it head on with pie-baking and a whole lot of play submissions, because I don't know how else to feel better about things. If a change about the play or Owl and Cat Theatre comes to light, I'll be sure to let you know, but for now, you can cancel your round-trip tickets for the closing of the show next weekend, because there ain't gonna be one.
