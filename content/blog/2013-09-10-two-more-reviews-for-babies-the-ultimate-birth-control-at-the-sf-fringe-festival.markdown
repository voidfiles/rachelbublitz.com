title: TWO More Reviews For BABIES THE ULTIMATE BIRTH CONTROL at the SF Fringe Festival
---

We have two more reviews for [BABIES, The Ultimate Birth Control](https://www.facebook.com/events/158170084370589/), woo!

>Sam writes: "Delightful vignettes! Great timing on the part of all the performers and overall a fun show!"

>And from [Carol Lashof](https://www.facebook.com/CarolSLashofPlaywright): "“Terrifyingly hilarious” as advertised. Terrifying, at any rate for those contemplating parenthood or who have young children. For empty-nesters and non-parents, just plain wickedly funny."

Only THREE shows left:

SATURDAY September 14 9:00 PM 

SUNDAY September 15 1:00 PM

TUESDAY September 17 9:00 PM
