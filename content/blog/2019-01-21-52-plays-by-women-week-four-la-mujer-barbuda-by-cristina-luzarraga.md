+++

Currently watching snow blanketing my neighborhood, but luckily I don't have to go out there to read plays! This week for [52 Play by Women](https://twitter.com/52playsbywomen) I read [Christina Luzárraga's *LA MUJER BARBUDA*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/206827/la-mujer-barbuda), which I found on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard). I've read shorter works from Luzárraga, so it was really exciting to pick up a full-length and see what her work looks like in long form. And I found out that I'm a big fan!

*LA MUJER BARBUDA* is a strange and wonderful play, one that messes with time in space, and takes on the complicated emotions after having a baby. Here's my full recommendation from the New Play Exchange:

>"Motherhood can be a hard transition, but this surprised me when I had my first child because mostly what we’re shown are euphoric women happy crying while staring at their babies. I wish I’d had a play like this to read or see to know that all those conflicting feelings weren’t wrong, and also that I wasn’t alone. This play is dark, funny, and strange. Luzárraga handles time, space, and language in a very creative way, and a huge hell yes to more breastfeeding on stage!"

You can find more of [Christina Luzárraga](https://newplayexchange.org/users/10516/cristina-luz%C3%A1rraga)'s work on her New Play Exchange profile, and I highly recommend you do!

Happy reading, and happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day!
