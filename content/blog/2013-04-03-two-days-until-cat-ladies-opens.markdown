title: TWO Days Until Cat Ladies Opens
---

Only two days before opening night of [All Terrain Theater Company](http://www.allterraintheater.org/)'s showcase, [WOMEN IN SOLODARITY: CAT LADIES](https://www.facebook.com/events/102148146638070/?fref=ts). The show is going so well! I hope you have gotten your tickets already! Oh, and if you'd like to advertise in the program, contact [Tracy Held Potter](mailto:tracy@allterraintheater.org) ASAP! 

Today I bring you more pictures taken by [Rob Reeves](http://suckypictures.blogspot.com/?zx=da79e9239054d5d), these are all of performer Ramya Vijayan rehearsing a monologue I wrote called, *It's Not You, It's Me*. Enjoy!
