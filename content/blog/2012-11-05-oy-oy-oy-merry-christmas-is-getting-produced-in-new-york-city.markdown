title: OY OY OY MERRY CHRISTMAS! is getting produced in New York!
---

My ten minute Christmas play *Oy Oy Oy Merry Christmas!* is going up in New York! Queens to be exact. I got the email yesterday getting off an airplane.... [Unity Stage Company](http://unitystage.org/unitystage.org/index.html.html) selected it for it's 2nd Annual Figgy Pudding Short Play Festival. Needless to say, I'm jazzed. The festival has four performances; Nov. 29th, 30th, and Dec. 1st at 8pm, and the final performance will be at 5pm on Dec. 2nd. All performances will be at [Cafe Marlene](http://www.cafemarlene.com/) in Queens, New York. If you're in the area, I hope that you'll check it out. I really love my short and quirky play, and I'm thrilled that someone selected it for their holiday program.
