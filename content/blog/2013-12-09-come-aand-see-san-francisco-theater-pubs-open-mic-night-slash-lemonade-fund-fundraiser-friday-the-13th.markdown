title: Come aAnd See San Francisco Theater Pub's Open Mic Night/Lemonade Fund Fundraiser
  Friday the 13th
---

This Friday, December 13th, come to [The Exit Theatre](http://www.theexit.org/) on Eddy street for [San Francisco Theater Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/)'s Open Mic Night/Lemonade Fund Fundraiser! The show starts at 8pm, and there is a suggested donation from $10-$20, although you should feel free to throw more money in! 

I'm working with local actor Melissa Keith, she'll be preforming a monologue written by Audrey and me! That's right, Audrey work will be shown on the stage again! So, if you missed *Audrey Scare People Play* and have hated yourself ever since, have no fear! You can see her new work *This Is How I Lost My Money* on Friday! There are also a ton of other great performers involved, and I'm confident that it will be a great night of fun! 

I hope you make it out!
