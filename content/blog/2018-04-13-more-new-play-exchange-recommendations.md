Happy Friday the 13th! 

On my hunt for that [National New Play Network](http://nnpn.org/) button I've been reading lots of plays on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) and writing recommendations for all the great ones I come across! I've had to be in catch up mode, since I was gone the first week of April, so I've been trying to write 4 recommendations a day. This has been an excellent distraction for me since I've *also* been waiting on big news. Plus, like I said, buttons. ANYhow, here are my most recent April #newdaynewplay recommendations on the New Play Exchange:

* ["*Love in the Time of Zombies*" by Kirk Shimano](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/15155/love-time-zombies)
* ["*Hilarity*" by Allison Page](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/31809/hilarity)
* ["*Hellhound*" by Allison Page](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/45420/hellhound)
* ["*MAMI'S HOUSE*" by Nelson Diaz-Marcano](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/144824/mamis-house)
* ["*Power/Responsibility*" by Alandra Hileman](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/92109/powerresponsibility)
* ["*Conditions*" by Jordan Elizabeth Henry](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/175273/conditions)
* ["*Rules of Comedy*" by Patricia Cotter](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/74825/rules-comedy)
* ["*Flesh, Blood, & Glass*" by Rachel Bykowski](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/173508/flesh-blood-glass)

Not sure I'll be able to keep up with four a day over the weekend with my kids screaming in my ears, but here's to hoping!
