title: PCSF Presents A Staged Reading of TERRIBLE PEOPLE Tonight Only
---

Don't let the BART strike get you down! Come out tonight and watch a hilarious one-act play in a staged reading! [Playwrights' Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/) presents a one night only staged reading of *Terrible People* TONIGHT! You don't need to buy tickets in advance, you can just show up at the door. You can RSVP, if you'd like! [RSVP here](https://www.facebook.com/events/343655022423837/)! And, since it's so hot, and the world seems to be on strike, I'm making (right this minute!) brownies for my audience! There will also be beer and pink lemonade!
