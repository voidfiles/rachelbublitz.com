My author copies arrived for [*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches?fbclid=IwAR3FAmCRiCFv1eQy1d0DjpfdvQx6jrAAJxGhSjTdulzZmRuyGwNPx_REMtg) and I am pleased as punch. As a writer, I want my words in beautifully bound books, and as a theater maker, I want my plays available to as many folks as possible and this does both at once! The cover makes me cry, it is just so beautiful. I was thrilled that the University of Utah gave us permission to use their artwork by Anne Oldroyd.

Thank you Jamie Wilcox, artistic director of the [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://egyptiantheatrecompany.org/index.php/youtheatre) (as well as founder/artist director of [Play Is The Thing](https://www.playisthething.org/)), Jamie commissioned the one-act version of this play and gave me the space to develop it further!

ALSO, huge thank you to Alexandra Harbold, who directed the premiere of the one-act version, and the premiere Zoom production of the full-length version this past Fall with thee University of Utah. May this be the start of many many many more collaborations!

Finally, huge thank you to Chris Reed, one of my best friends, and terribly talented actors. Thank you for bringing the story to my attention oh so many years ago.

I wrote a play! And now it's published! And soon (I hope!) it will delight audiences and readers across the country.

If you're looking for a script for that special theater lover and/or artist in your life, consider ordering a copy (or ten!). It's stocking sizes, AND has approximately one million excellent monologues for actors that are also women. And you can buy one right [HERE](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches?fbclid=IwAR3FAmCRiCFv1eQy1d0DjpfdvQx6jrAAJxGhSjTdulzZmRuyGwNPx_REMtg)!

The one-act version of the script will be coming out soon, hoping for early in 2021!

Hope you are well and healthy and staying sane!
