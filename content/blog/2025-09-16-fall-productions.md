Summer has come and gone, Fall is here! I'm excited to keep my windows open, wear my favorite beanie, and go outside for more than five minutes without a ton of sweat pouring out of my body. But I'm even more excited because Fall is packed with productions of my plays around the country (and one in Australia)! I am so excited I even mapped out all the places my work is going up:
