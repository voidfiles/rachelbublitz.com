title: HAPPY HALLOWEEN!
---

To wish you a special Halloween, I'm reposting a *super* creepy one-minute play I wrote last August. It's called *Peeper*...


###*Peeper*, a one-minute play by Rachel Bublitz

*It is very quiet. TOM is on stage, HE has a pair of binoculars and looks out with them on one specific spot.*
 
####TOM

I like to imagine what her name is.

I have narrowed it down to 84 possibilities, and I am certain that it is one of them. 

Some nights I call them out to her.

Amy?...

I do not yell. I would never yell at her.

Sarah?...

When you watch someone as long as I have watched her you learn things about them. For example, I know that her name cannot be Jackie. I know this. 

Deborah?...

No, not Deborah. That makes for 83. 

83 possibilities. 

Hmmm...

*TOM moves closer to the spot he is watching. TOM’s breathing becomes audible and quick. TOM speaks quickly.*

####TOM (*CONTINUED*)

There goes her blouse.

Tonight the bra she wears is black. 

She did not shave under her arms this morning. 

*Pause. TOM’s speech and breath return to normal.*

####TOM (*CONTINUED*)

Now her light is off.

*TOM lowers his binoculars.*

####TOM (*CONTINUED*)

Sweet dreams. April?...

*End.*
