[*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) has been selected for [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/)'s [The Problematic Play Festival](http://www.zspace.org/problematic) this October 12th, 13th, and 14th in San Francisco! I can't wait to work on this play with the amazing artists at Z Space, and to spend time with the other playwrights involved! The full line-up is:

[Rachel Lynett](https://newplayexchange.org/users/2611/rachel-lynett)’s "*Refuge*"   
[Rachel Bublitz](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz)'s (hey that's me!) "*Ripped*"  
[Cory Hinkle](https://newplayexchange.org/users/137/cory-hinkle)’s "*Phosphorescence*"

The reading of *RIPPED* is scheduled for Saturday, October 13th. But stay tuned for more (like actors, director, and tickets!) as we get closer....
