Coming up next week, February 3, [Peninsula Players Theatre](https://peninsulaplayers.com/) will present a reading of my play [*Of Serpents & Sea Spray*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/of-serpents-sea-spray) in their 2025 season of [The Play's The Thing](https://peninsulaplayers.com/2025/01/08/peninsula-players-theatre-announces-2025-winter-play-reading-series/), their winter reading serious!

Fun coincidence, the play is dedicated to my daughter, Audrey, and this reading is presented in coordination with [Door County Reads](https://www.doorcountylibrary.org/doorcountyreads.html) which has paired the staged reading of *Of Serpents & Sea Spray* with an exploration of my daughter's favorite book: "The House in the Cerulean Sea" by TJ Klune. Isn't it fun when everything comes full circle like that?

*Of Serpents & Sea Spray* will be read Monday, February 3, in the breath taking [Bj√∂rklunden](https://www.lawrence.edu/bjorklunden) building, at 7590 Boynton Lane, Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin, at 7:00 p.m. Seating is first come, first served, and tickets are free! Donations are welcome.

If you're nearby, do check the reading out! Sounds absolutely incredible.
