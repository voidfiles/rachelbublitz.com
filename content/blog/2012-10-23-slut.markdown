title: SLUT, tonight!
---

For all of those folks who missed the great show put on by Playwrights' Center of SF last night, don't worry! You can still catch MY BODY (my 10 minute play dealing with woman's rights) tonight! That's right, and it'll be really easy if you already happen to be in the Washington DC area. 

If you can't make it out, but would like to help, [The Disreputables](http://www.disreputables.org/index.html) are taking donations [here](http://www.indiegogo.com/SLUT). They're less than $500 away from their goal! Be sure and help them reach it, if you can!
