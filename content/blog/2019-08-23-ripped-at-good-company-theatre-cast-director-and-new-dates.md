Happy August 23rd! It's the day of my Mother's birth, so before I get to *RIPPED* announcements, Happy Birthday Momma! Hope Hawaii is swell!

Now, back to business... [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz) will have its second production, and that production will kick off in less than a month! [Good Company Theatre](https://www.goodcotheatre.com/), in Ogden, Utah, has started rehearsals for a September 20th opening. So for all my Utah friends who couldn't make the San Francisco trip, now is your chance!

And we have a director and a cast! It is all very *very* exciting....
