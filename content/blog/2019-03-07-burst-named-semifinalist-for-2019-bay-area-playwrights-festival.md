While no longer in consideration for the 2019 [Bay Area Playwrights Festival](https://playwrightsfoundation.org/our-programs/bay-area-playwrights-festival/bapf/), I was pleased to find out (and happy to share with you!) that my full length play [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) was named a semifinalist! It's one of those instances where the universe really knows best since I'd just received notification that another play of mine will be workshopped in July (that news is on its way), and science isn't quite up to the task of having me be in two places at once yet.

But, *BURST* has been getting a *lot* of attention, with three readings last year; R.E.A.C.H at [Utah Shakespeare Festival](https://www.bard.org/), [Salt Lake Acting Company](https://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/new-play-development/new-play-sounding-series/item/1406-burst-by-rachel-bublitz), and [Keegan Theatre's Boiler Room Series](https://keegantheatre.com/about/boiler-room-series/#1542130284179-87cb9332-5f10). And and and there's more on the horizon that I can't quite announce yet...

Want to know more about the play?? Here's a synopsis:

>Sarah Boyd is an extraordinary human being. Not only did she build her company from scratch using nothing but willpower and fortitude, she also sits on the precipice of truly saving this planet. Because on top of being one of the fastest growing tech companies in history, Tactix, with Sarah at its helm, will usher this planet into the post-plastic era. A time where we need not worry or fret over the great destruction being done to our world from this non-biodegradable foe. With her eyes steady on her next round of funding, Sarah must persevere through a late night interview with a particularly tough reporter, a lawsuit aimed at a person from her past, and the waffling of her CTO. It's a heavy load, and Sarah knows that she is the only one great enough to bear it.

It's a one scene play with a cast of three women.... I seriously love this play so much. If you're itching to know more, don't worry, you can pop on over to [my New Play Exchange page](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz) and give it a read. And if you've read or seen it before, right now a brand new version is up! Maybe now is a good time to re-read?

Good luck to all the finalists for the 2019 Bay Area Playwrights Festival, I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!
