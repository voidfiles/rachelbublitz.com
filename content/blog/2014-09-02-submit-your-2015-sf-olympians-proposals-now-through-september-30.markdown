title: Submit Your 2015 SF Olympians Proposals Now Through September 30
---

The [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) is taking submissions for their 2015 festival: 

#SAN FRANCISCO OLYMPIANS FESTIVAL VI: WINE DARK SEA

If you are a writer and live in the Bay Area, apply. Don't think about it, just do it. This has been one of the most rewarding community of artists that I have ever worked with. So get on it. NOW!

Here are all the details from their website:

Want to write for the Olympians Festival?

Well, now is your chance!

We are now accepting submissions for the 2015 San Francisco Olympians Festival, a multi-discipline, nationally recognized new works theater festival based at the EXIT Theatre in San Francisco!

Proposals due by midnight on September 30th, with the line-up for next year’s festival to be announced 11/1/2014. Our first meeting will be on December 12 of 2014.

The festival will take place in November of 2015, from November 4-November 21, Wedesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights at 8 PM.

Each night of the festival will consist of the staged reading of either a full-length play or a series of shorts, inspired by the mythical gods and heroes of Ancient Greece. The subjects, and the lengths of the plays we’re looking for, are specified below.

There are no submission fees. The Olympians Festival is non-exclusive and does not retain ownership of any play created for it, beyond the initial staged reading. Participating writers should be local (San Francisco and the greater Bay Area), and will be expected to help promote the festival and contribute a raffle prize of their choice to be raffled off to the audience on the night their play is read. Writers are also expected to attend 4-6 meetings over the course of the year, and our auditions, which happen in September.

Writers are encouraged to submit as many proposals as they want for as many topics as they like. Applications for a topic can be submitted by individuals or writers can work in pairs, or teams of three or more. Writers may be picked for more than one project, and should note that they’d like to be considered for more than one (or not). Each proposal should be 500 words or less and answer three questions:

1. Why you?
2. Why this figure?
3. What is your idea?

All proposals should be submitted electronically to Stuart at [sfolympians@gmail.com](mailto:sfolympians@gmail.com).
