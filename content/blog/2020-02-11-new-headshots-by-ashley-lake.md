It's that very special time, NEW HEADSHOTS!

![Headshot of Rachel Bublitz.](/images/Bublitz_headshot_2020_update.jpg)

My good friend [Ashley Lake](https://www.instagram.com/ashleyklake/?hl=en) also happens to be a wonderful photographer and agreed to update my headshot for me. She's taken a ton of family portraits for us, and I love how she always manages to capture so much personality with her work. She took a pretty epic shot of my son once, and I was looking to have a picture with a similar amount of gravitas. And she totally nailed it.

There are a few other great shots, I'm putting my favorites on an album on my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/rachelnbublitz/) if you're looking to see more! Three cheers for having talented friends!!
