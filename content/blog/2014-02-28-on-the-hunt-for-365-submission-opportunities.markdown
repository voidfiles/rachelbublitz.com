title: On The Hunt For 365 Submission Opportunities
---

There are 365 days in a year, and that is how many times I plan on submitting plays this year. Crazy? Maybe a little, but I'm in it to win it. Today is the last day of the month, and so I'm catching you up on my number of submissions to date. And that number is.........

####53!

53? What a lot of plays! Unfortunately, I will admit that I've fallen a bit behind (I should be up to 59), but March is all my month, and I'm going go after it with a vengeance. 

Only 312 submissions left to go!
