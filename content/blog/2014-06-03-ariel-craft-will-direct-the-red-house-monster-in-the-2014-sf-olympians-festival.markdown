title: Ariel Craft Will Direct THE RED HOUSE MONSTER in the 2014 SF Olympians Festival
---

[Ariel Craft](http://www.btabtheatreco.org/about), Executive Director for [Bigger Than A Bread Box Theatre Co.](http://www.btabtheatreco.org/), and all around badass, is directing my one-act play, *The Red House Monster*, for the 2014 [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/)'s Monster's Ball! I'm thrilled. I'm ecstatic. I'm jazzed.

My monster is Geryon, and if you want more info about him or the direction my play will take, here's the description from the San Francisco Olympians site:

>"Geryon, a three-bodied giant, was the son of Chrysaor and Callirrhoe. Geryon was made famous because Hercules’ tenth labor involved stealing his large red cattle. When Hercules arrived on Erytheia, the island Geryon lived, he stole Geryon’s cattle, killed Geryon’s two headed dog Orthus, then killed Geryon’s herdsman Eurytion, and finally killed Geryon with a poisoned arrow. There are many descriptions of what exactly “three bodied” means, some say that he had one body with three heads, others say that he had three bodies connected at the stomach. Geryon is also characterized as being red and also winged, at times. Regardless of his features, he proved to be a worthy adversary giving Hercules one of his toughest battles."

>"Rachel Bublitz’s one-act play, THE RED HOUSE MONSTER, chronicles the story of Hannah Gold, a young lady living on an island off the coast of Massachusetts in the late 1800s, and the night that changed her life. Filled with small town lore, haunted houses, spirits, monsters, pistols, pie, and mysteries, it is a play that will keep you guessing just what is in the Red House, and who, in fact, you should be afraid of."
