It's always a fun day when I can announce a new project, and even more fun when that project is a commission! Matt Sincell, a teacher at Rowland Hall here in Salt Lake City, is commissioning a new play for his students about the Great Salt Lake! I've started researching, and plan on having the first draft written and ready to workshop by February.

The plan is to have the World Premiere of this new yet-to-be-titled play later in the Spring of 2023. Want to know more? Check back for updates as I figure out how I tackle this new play!

Happy Wednesday and last day of November (oy vey, time is going by *so fast*)!
