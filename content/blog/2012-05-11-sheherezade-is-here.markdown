title: Sheherezade Is Here
---

Tonight is opening night for Sheherezade XII! I'm so excited. Dress rehearsal last night was awesome. I was slightly emotional, seeing something that I'd written completely transformed for the first time. Kat Kneisel is my brilliant director who really gave my piece life. I'm so very pleased at what she's done with "Her Special Day." And, my two wonderful actors, Abby Edber and Diana Brown blew my mind. This has been a very special experience for me.

It was also fun to see the other plays come to life that I'd only ever heard read at developmental readings. The entire night has been put together very well. All the actors and directors involved did a great job!

I think that Playwright's Center and Wily West deserve a standing ovation! So, buy your tickets today! The show runs only three weekends, and I would not be surprised if it started selling out. I'll be there tonight and closing night. Make sure to let me know what you think of "Her Special Day."
