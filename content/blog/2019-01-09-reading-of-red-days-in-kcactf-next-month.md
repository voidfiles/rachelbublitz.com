Great news, next month in Eugene, Oregon, on top of getting to workshop [*RED DAYS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232234/red-days) through the New Play Design through Dramaturgy program, the Region 7 KCACTF Conference will also feature a reading of the play! It'll be my very first time hearing it out loud in front of an audience!

I'm so excited/nervous for the reading, and thrilled with how much I know the play will grow over the week with so much special attention.

The reading of *RED DAYS* will be directed by [Stephen John](https://www.stephenjohn.org/?fbclid=IwAR12EbE6ddv6WCUFNUNORBZvq1tiQfxMolZVG17l8loYQC5UBmEhXd1SSAU), a MFA Candidate in Directing at the University of Idaho. More info, like venue, date, and time are on their way, so stay tuned!

Now the first two month of the year have public performances in it, can I somehow wrangle the rest of the year and repeat 2018's glory?.....
