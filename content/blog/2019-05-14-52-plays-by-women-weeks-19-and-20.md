I was off in San Diego last week celebrating Mother's Day with mi familia and couldn't share the two plays by women I read for week 19 of [52 Plays by Women](https://twitter.com/52playsbywomen).... They were: [*STRAIGHT WHITE MEN* by Young Jean Lee](https://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=5483) and [*HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS AND THEN KILL THEM* by Halley Feiffer](https://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=5147). I received *STRAIGHT WHITE MEN* in my [DPS Book Club](https://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=5748) which I highly reccomend you sign up for... Four times a year you get seven mystery plays in a box shipped to your home. They're a mix of brand new titles and plays from Dramatists Play Service's back catalogue. And it is SO FUN! Every month is seven different adventures in a box. And you get a huge discount, more than 40% off their retail price. So get on that!

For this week, week 20, I'm going to see the world premiere of [*SWEETHEART COME* by Melissa Leilani Larson](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/62069/sweetheart-come) at [PYGmalion Productions](http://pygmalionproductions.org/), directed by Mark Fossen. I'm seeing the final performance, which is this Saturday the 18th of May. But it's also playing the 16th, 17th, and has two performances on the 18th. More about the play:

>"Emma Hauck realizes that her husband's political ambitions are changing himâ€”and their marriage. She finds refuge in her writing, and in the unexpected friendship of a new servant. As both relationships grow more complex, Emma most face difficult truths about herself that she never knew existed."

Melissa Leilani Larson is a local Salt Lake City playwright, and my buddy. Very excited to see her show!
