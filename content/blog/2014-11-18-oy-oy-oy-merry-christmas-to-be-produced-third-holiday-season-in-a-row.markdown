title: OY, OY, OY, MERRY CHRISTMAS! to be produced third holiday season in a row!
---

[The James Downing Theatre](http://www.jamesdowningtheatre.com/) in Chicago will be producing my short Christmas play OY OY OY, MERRY CHRISTMAS! And I'm super excited! This will be the third year in a row that OY OY OY, MERRY CHRISTMAS! has been produced in a holiday show! Sadly, I won't be making it out to Chicago for the show, but one day I hope to see it produced.

If you're in the Chicago area, be sure to check out Father Zamboni's Christmas Shorts December 5th and 6th at 7:30, and December 7th at 1:30. More info on their website: [http://www.jamesdowningtheatre.com/](http://www.jamesdowningtheatre.com/)

And if you DO make it out, let me know how it went! I love to hear about my plays' adventures.
