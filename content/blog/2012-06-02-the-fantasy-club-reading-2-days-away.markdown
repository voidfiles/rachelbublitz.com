That's right folks! You've been waiting for months and weeks, and now we're finally down to just days! Two days until the staged reading of THE FANTASY CLUB! 

Tomorrow we have our first rehearsal! I am so excited to be working with so many talented artists. I hope that you can make it out, and tell everyone you know that produces theatre to be there too!

Here are the details, in case you've forgotten:
