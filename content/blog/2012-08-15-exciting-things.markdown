title: Exciting Things
---

A theatre requested I send them "The Fantasy Club" today! How exciting is that? Very, very. I send out a lot of samples of plays, *lots*, and I usually (or until today) have never heard from anyone again. But today I got an email asking for the entire script. And, since their theatre looks for work that hasn't been done in Colorado (it's a Colorado based theatre), I think it's just fine that a production is already coming together here. I told them about it, so we'll see. 

I wonder, should I email all the places I've submitted "The Fantasy Club" and tell them it's being produced somewhere? Is that a thing folks do? Hmmm... Well, even if I never hear anything from this, I was over the moon to get this email today. Oh... And if we're talking about things that boost my playwright confidence, I emailed an actor about doing a private developmental read at my house... She emailed me back yes, and that after looking over my website (yes *this* very website!) that she was eager to work with me because she loves my writing. Maybe she was just blowing smoke up my ass, but I don't care. I'm takin' it. I'm lovin' it. Alright... Back to writing plays...
