My play [*Codename: White Mouse*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/48794/codename-white-mouse), about real-life badass Nancy Wake, opens next month on February 16th, at [The Lind](https://www.lindlane.com.au/) in Nambour, Australia. Here's more about the play:

>*When the Germans invade France, Nancy, a rich socialite house wife, isn’t able to sit back and do nothing. Despite her husband's objections, she gets involved with the resistance. For Nancy it’s a slippery slope and soon she graduates from delivering letters to breaking men out of concentration camps. Forced to flee the country with the Gestapo and Vichy on her heals, she is lead to safety over the Pyrenees Mountains. Nancy, however, isn’t satisfied with a quiet life back in England and requests quickly to be sent back into the fight.*  

The play was originally written for the Loud & Unladylike Festival in San Francisco, receiving two staged readings. This will be its first full production! I'm so excited for it to be getting up on its feet, I only wish I could be there to see it.

*Codename: White Mouse* runs through February 24, if you find yourself in that part of the world I hope you'll check out the production!
