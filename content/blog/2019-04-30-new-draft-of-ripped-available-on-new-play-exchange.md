Hot off the presses after a phenomenal first week of rehearsal at [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/) in San Francisco I have a brand new draft of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) uploaded on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz)! I was already incredibly excited for this world premiere, but after working with my director, Lisa Steindler (the executive artistic director of Z Space) for the week I am in a whole new place that the word excited can't even begin to cover. I'm basically buzzing, and I'm not sure if I can or will ever stop.

Also amazing this week was seeing/hearing the design concepts from the rest of our creative team: Maya Herbsman (Intimacy Director), Colm McNally (Set and Lighting Designer), Camille Simoneau (Assistant Lighting Designer), Sara Huddleston (Sound Designer), Christina Dinkel (Costume Designer), Hannah Clague (Props Designer), and Rose Oser (Creative Producer). Adding to the dream team, and making my life better in so many ways was stage manager Christina Hogan, who is on TOP if life and this play, and our production assistant, Kat Cuchiara-Armstrong, the other native San Diegan in the room.

My actors are the brilliant Krystle Piamonte as Lucy, Daniel Chung as Jared, and Edwin Jacobs as Bradley. And being able to fine-tune the script with all of these peoples' input was a joy and an honor. The script was already great (in my humble opinion), and now, like my excitement, the word great doesn't even cover it. You can read it for yourself if you want to see what you're in for, ([find the new draft of *RIPPED* right here!](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped])) OR you can buy your tickets for the show here: [www.zspace.org/rippedshow](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow)! Or best practice, do BOTH!

*RIPPED* kicks off May 22, and runs through June 15 at Z Below in San Francisco!
