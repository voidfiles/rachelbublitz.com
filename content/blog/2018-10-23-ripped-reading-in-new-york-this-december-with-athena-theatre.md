Wheeeeeee!

Came home from an amazing trip with mi familia to Capital Reef National Park to find out that [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) has been selected for a reading with [Athena Theatre](http://www.athenatheatre.com/) in New York! And even better, they've shifted the date of the reading for when I will be in New York City so that I can attend! My New York trip keeps getting better and better and better.

This is a private table reading with the company, so I won't be sharing the details and inviting everyone to attend, BUT, (also good news) *RIPPED* is being considered for a production with Athena Theatre as well! And you had better believe if that comes through I will shout it from the roof tops and invite everyone on this planet earth.

Yay!

Happy Tuesday everyone!
