Heading out in a few hours to the airport for my next writing adventure: the workshop of [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) in [Theatre 33](http://www.theatre33.org/)'s Summer Season in Salem, Oregon!

Here are all the details in case you happen to be in the area:

*BURST* by Rachel Bublitz  
directed by Theresa Robbins Dudeck

June 12th (that's today!), 13th, 14th, and 15th at 7pm  
June 15th and 16th at 2pm

[M. Lee Pelton Theatre](https://www.google.com/maps/place/M.+Lee+Pelton+Theatre/@44.9360962,-123.0297298,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9beb0a35135c021?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjIh7_kjOTiAhUBM6wKHXV4BhMQ_BIwCnoECA4QCA) at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon

>Sarah Boyd is an extraordinary human being. Not only did she build her company from scratch using nothing but willpower and fortitude, she also sits on the precipice of truly saving this planet. Because on top of being one of the fastest growing tech companies in history, Tactix, with Sarah at its helm, will usher this planet into the post-plastic era. A time where we need not worry or fret over the great destruction being done to our world from this non-biodegradable foe. With her eyes steady on her next round of funding, Sarah must persevere through a late night interview with a particularly tough reporter, a lawsuit aimed at a person from her past, and the waffling of her CTO. It's a heavy load, and Sarah knows that she is the only one great enough to bear it.

After each of the performances there will be a talkback with me and the dramaturg on the project, Deb Vaughn.

I hope you'll come out and see me and this workshop, it's always exciting to see a new play getting up on its feet for the first time!
