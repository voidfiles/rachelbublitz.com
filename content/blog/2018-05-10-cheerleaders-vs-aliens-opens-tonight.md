THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME MY FRIENDS!

[*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119869/cheerleaders-vs-aliens) opens at the [Egyptian Theatre on Main Street in Park City, Utah](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Egyptian+Theatre/@40.6425688,-111.4949029,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xe6879db7c5bad651!8m2!3d40.6425688!4d-111.4949029) TONIGHT at 7pm!

I have ALL the butterflies and my heart is go-go-going and I just might puke!

We got a great little write up about the play, with an interview with a few of the cast members in Park City's [ParkRecord](https://www.parkrecord.com/entertainment/cheeleaders-vs-aliens-does-flips-with-its-roles-for-girls/), which also shares a bit of my artistic statement! Read it! Buy tickets! See me and the play TONIGHT! Or tomorrow, or Saturday, you choice!

Okay, time to sit and wait and try my hardest not to freak out all day.

Happy Thursday! Happy Opening! Wishing everyone BROKEN LEGS!
