title: Submissions 29 and 30
---

Here we go... Coming up on finishing the binge for this month. It was harder than I thought. This was the first time I've kept up with it, I can't wait to try again this coming March. If you didn't know, [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/playwrightbinge/) happens ever March and September.

I sent #29 (TERRIBLE PEOPLE) off to [Phoenix Stage Company](http://phoenixstagecompany.org/Home.html). They are looking for one-act plays (30 minutes max), previous productions are alright as long as they were limited, and you can email or snail mail your plays. One play per playwright, and the deadline is December 15th.

And finally, submission 30 was emailed off to [Big Head Productions](http://obsidianartspace.org/short-play-submissions.html).... They got my short play MY BODY. They're looking for scripts that range from 5-15 minutes and take place in an office. The deadline is October 15th, and you can email your script.

Oy vey! I'm glad that's over!
