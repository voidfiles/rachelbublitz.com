title: Just Breathe
---

I'm frantically getting everything ready for tomorrow... Emailing playwrights, creating a playwright blog bundle, adding names to our ever growing playwright list, writing blogs, organizing interviews, and answering so so so many questions. What have I done? Oh, August is going to be BUSY. Sure, I'm writing 31 plays... That's *nothing* compared to organizing all of this. But it's for the greater good, right?

I think that in order to get more people into theatres to see plays we need to shake things up. We need to think outside the box, and do things differently every so often. I'm not saying that [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com) is going to revolutionize theatre, but I do think that projects like this help to remind everyone that theatre is *not* a dying art. It is living, it is vibrant, and it should not be ignored. We have over 300 (we might make it to 400!) playwrights from around the world creating 31 new pieces of art. Yes, it helps the playwright fine tune their craft, but it also has potential to create pieces that speak to the human condition right now. It's bringing a community together. That's why I've decided to forgot sanity for a month.

So, as August 1st gets closer with each and every minute, I remind myself to breathe.... In the end it will all be worth it. And for all of your playwrights out there with fear and doubt rising in your bodies with our looming challenge about to begin, remember... Just breathe.
