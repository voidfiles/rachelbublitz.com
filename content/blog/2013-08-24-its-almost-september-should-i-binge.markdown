title: It's Almost September, Should I Binge?
---

In case you don't know, I'm talking about [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/playwrightbinge/), not binge eating donuts or anything... Although right now, that sounds fantastic.

No, what I'm wondering if I should try and submit 30 scripts next month. It's an bi-annual challenge, like [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/), except it pushes folks to submit a play for each day. I did it last September, and I did it last March... And I got some productions, readings, and one publication from pushing myself to submit so much... And that's good. BUT, I am *exhausted*, and I'm about to start grad school. I'm not sure putting more stuff out there is the best idea for me right now, *but* maybe not pushing myself is also a bad idea....

In the end I'm pretty sure I'll just suck it up and get the plays out. BUT, a vacation sounds pretty sweet right now, I'm not going to lie. I suppose I'll rest sometime next year... 

Anyway, [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/playwrightbinge/) starts September 1st, if you're a playwright looking for a new challenge once [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/) is done, you should seriously think about taking part.
