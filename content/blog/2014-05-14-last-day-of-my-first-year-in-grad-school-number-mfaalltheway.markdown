title: 'Last Day Of My First Year In Grad School #MFAAllTheWay'
---

This semester is still a blur, so it's hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that today is my last class in my first year of grad school. But it's true, so my head is just going to have to deal with it.

I am in the midst of planning for the fall, and also preparing myself for a sumer school class (an online course on writing screenplays!). So I won't have a ton of time off before it's back to the grindstone, but that's okay with me... I kind of like the grindstone.

There's a lot of talk about MFA's and if they're necessary/helpful in the theater world, and I think I've realized now that my first year is under my belt that for me, at least, it creates an organized/regulated aspect to the development of my craft, and so it's absolutely worth it. It might have something to do with having kids, because I don't just automatically have all this carved out time that I am able to write and think about writing, that's always been something I have to create for myself. I have always had to make the time happen, and I think school helps to define that time and make it more sacred. It doesn't allow me to put things on hold if I'm tired because I was up late with a sick kid, and I think that is what I need at this point, and so I'm on the worth it side of the debate. We'll see if I'm singing a different song when I graduate though.

Okay, time to get back to work for me! But don't forget about *Much Ado About Mathletes*, it was hilarious last night and has two more performances (Thursday at 7 and Saturday at 2).
