I'm coming your way Bay Area! I leave Friday with plans to eat everything in sight, and theater stuff too... Probably. No, there will be plenty of theater. I'm catching [Cutting Ball](http://cuttingball.com/)'s production of Paula Vogel's [THE MINEOLA TWINS](http://cuttingball.com/productions/the-mineola-twins/), directed by one of my favorite people/directors ever [Ariel Craft](http://cuttingball.com/staff-artists/) on Saturday night, and reading two, yes TWO, of my new plays on Sunday. We'll be reading *BURST* at a last-minute super informal breakfast jam at my good friend [Claire Rice](http://claireannrice.blogspot.com/)'s house, and then heading over to Berkeley for the table read of *HAPPILY* with [Quantum Dragon Theatre](https://www.quantumdragon.org/), a part of their Forge Program for developing new genre theater! I'm so excited and I just can't hide it, and I'm going to eat everything I can get my hands on and hug the hell out everyone I see. GET READY!
