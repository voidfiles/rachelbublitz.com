Good news of the day! I wrote a ten-minute play (today!) that's scheduled to be produced by [Plan-B Theatre](https://planbtheatre.org/) this coming August for [Rose Exposed](http://roseexposed.org/)! 

What *is* Rose Exposed? I'm so happy you asked!

>"ROSE EXPOSED is an annual event produced by the Performing Arts Coalition to bring audience and artists together. Simply put, we want you to get in the habit of coming to the [Rose Wagner Performing Arts Center](https://artsaltlake.org/venue/rose-wagner-center/).

>"Each year, ROSE EXPOSED features short works created around a unifying theme by each of the Rose Wagner's resident companies (some pieces are created the week of the event; others are created that same day): [Gina Bachauer International Piano Foundation](https://www.bachauer.com/), [Pygmalion Theatre Company](http://pygmalionproductions.org/), Plan-B Theatre Company, [Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company](https://ririewoodbury.com/), [Repertory Dance Theatre](http://www.rdtutah.org/), and [SB Dance](http://www.sbdance.com/)."

And I am *thrilled* to have my fellow Plan-B Lab member, the incredible [Jennifer Kokai](https://newplayexchange.org/users/2116/jennifer-kokai) signed on to direct my piece! Rose Exposed is set and scheduled for ONE NIGHT ONLY, so get out your calendar and mark yourself as busy on Saturday, August 25th at 8pm (that's when the show is happening)! Tickets will go on sale August 1st, and once they do I will provide all the links you'll need for purchasing.

In addition to ticket info, I'll also be posting about this year's theme, my play, and the cast as we get closer and things are finalized, so stay tuned for updates!

Happy Wednesday!
