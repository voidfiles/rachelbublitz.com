### 2022 IS NEARLY OVER!

'Twas a big year, which kept me quite busy in my writing and theater making. Thought I'd highlight some of my most exciting moments....

![2022 Playwriting Collage.](/images/2022-playwriting-in-pictures.jpg)

Top left: [*Burst*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) was named a finalist for the National New Play Network's 2022 Showcase!  

Top middle left: [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) received more requests than any of my other plays ever have, after the Supreme Court Decision to knock down Roe V. Wade, which resulted in readings and performances at colleges across the country. My offer for royalty-free performances still stands, by the way! If you are a student and want to put this play up, let me know! If you can pay, know that all proceeds go to NARAL Pro-Choice America.  

Top middle right: [*Let's Fix Andy*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119863/lets-fix-andy) had a workshop and reading with Salt Lake Acting Company, which was not only a tremendous blast, but helped the play grow leaps and bounds.  

Top right and middle right: [*Burst*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) had its World Premiere with Alleyway Theatre in Buffalo, NY. The production was AMAZING top to bottom, and the city was a beautiful one for me to explore.  

Bottom right: [*The Book Women*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/products/the-book-women) had its first productions! And the play is available for you to order. It makes a beautiful script in your hand, just so you know.

Bottom middle left: [*Blood & Sequins*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1646616/blood-sequins) had its World Premiere with Utica High School! The students had a bloody good time!  

Bottom left: The director of [*Burst*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst), Daniel F. Lendzian, and me at a post-show talk back. Isn't that set just gorgeous?  

Middle left: [*Ripped*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/ripped) was published with Original Works Publishing!! And is set to receive its San Diego Premiere with Loud Fridge Theater Group in early 2023!  

Inside left: [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) had a developmental production with PlayGround in the summer, and was a rousing success!  

Inside right: My latest published work, the one-act version of [*Biz Town*](https://www.playscripts.com/play/5600), a laugh-out-loud noir comedy! It is just perfect for middle and high school productions, available with Playscripts!   

There was more fun happenings, of course, the [*Tip Top Triangle*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1945151/tip-top-triangle) workshop with Plan-B, and teaching playwriting both at Weber State University and the Egyptian YouTheatre, but you can fit only so much on a photo collage.  

Here's to hoping that 2023 will be as challenging and fulfilling!!!

### Happy Holidays and Happy New Year, everyone!
