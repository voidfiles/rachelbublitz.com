Hooray hooray I can finally spill ALL the beans about this year's [Rose Exposed](http://roseexposed.org/)! I wrote a ten-minute for [Plan-B Theatre](http://planbtheatre.org/)'s slot for this year's Rose Exposed, and now I can share the play, the cast, and more exciting details about the program, like that there will be a LIVE piano player on stage! Eeeeee!
