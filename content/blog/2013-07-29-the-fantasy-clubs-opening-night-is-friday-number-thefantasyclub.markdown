I can't believe it, but opening night of *The Fantasy Club* is FRIDAY! As in *this* Friday! The show is going to be HILARIOUS. One that you do not want to miss! I mean, look at this cast:

[Siobhan Doherty](http://www.siobhanmariedoherty.com/)... Frances

Tavis Kammet... Max

[Claire Rice](http://claireannrice.blogspot.com/)... Samantha

[Rob Dario](https://sites.google.com/site/thenewrobdariotimes/)... Jacob

And with [Tracy Held Potter](https://www.facebook.com/TracyHeldPotter?fref=ts) as the director, you know it's going to be good! And to sweeten the pot, you should know this is the LAST show that Tracy will direct before she goes leaves for grad school next month.

The time is now, friends... BUY YOUR TICKETS!

You have two choices:

Lots of great people involved, and a sexy/hilarious script. You know what to do!
