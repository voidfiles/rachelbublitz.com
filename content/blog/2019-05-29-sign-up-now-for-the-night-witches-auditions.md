Summer is almost here, which means we're getting closer to the [Egyptian Youtheatre](http://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) workshop and world premiere production of [*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches) at the [Salt Lake Fringe Festival](https://www.facebook.com/greatsaltlakefringe/)! I'm excited, are you excited?

More about my play, *THE NIGHT WITCHES*:

>"Inspired by the real-life unsung heroines of WWII...

>"The first women ever to fly in combat flew for the Soviet Union during the Second World War, they were known as the Night Witches. They flew in outdated planes made of canvas and wood, and dropped their bombs on their German enemy every fifteen minutes during the night to keep them from sleeping. Using movement, song, lyrical spoken word, and dialogue we follow these brave young women through one evening during the war."

The workshop/summer camp will run up in Park City, July 8-12. It's a really fun opportunity for any young actors/theater artists to see how a new play gets developed. We'll have a range of activities which will often involve brand new pages, and lots of movement experiments with the fabulous director, Alexandra Harbold. [Sign-up for the workshop here](http://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre)!

Auditions are scheduled for July 12, 12-1:30, with callbacks later that day at 4pm (if needed). You can find more information, including rehearsal schedule and character list, for [auditions right here](http://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/our-next-show)!

Be sure to reach out if you have questions, and share with any young actors planning to be in the Salt Lake/Park City area in July and August.
