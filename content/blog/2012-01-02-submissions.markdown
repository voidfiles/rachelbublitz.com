title: Submissions
---

I just made my first submission of 2012!  I submitted to The Well, a theatre company in New York.  They used my favorite method for submissions.  Emailing just the script.  So many theatres want so much extra information, I sometimes feel that I write more essays about the theme, characters, or the synopsis of my play than actual words in my script.  I doubt that’s true, but that’s how I feel.

In 2011 I submitted “The Fantasy Club” 38 times, “The Anniversary” 18 times, “Bill and Kelly” 4 times, and “Her Special Day” twice, for a total of 62 submissions.  I’m waiting to find out the result of most of my submissions, but so far I’ve had 9 rejections, and 1 acceptance.  I wrote 3 ten minute plays in 2011, and one full length play.  I’m pretty excited about those numbers, especially when I remember that I started writing again in August.

Looking to 2012 I have some goals (not resolutions).  I want to complete another full length play and 4 more short or one act plays.  I want to make it to 150 submissions, and I’d like 10 theatres or publishers to use my work.  I would also like to read one play a week.  I just finished “Henry IV” by Pirandello (translated by Stoppard), and I’m currently reading “Proof” by David Auburn.  

Here’s looking to a more productive year!
