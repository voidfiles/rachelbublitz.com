It's March! Women's History Month! I thought I'd take a moment to highlight my plays that center women's history before April got here. And, with the current administration doing the terrible things its doing, I can promise you I will be writing more plays centering women's history. I'm thinking at least one full-length a year.

But back to the positive! Here are my full-length history plays that are out in the world now:

## [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches)

Available through [Dramatic Publishing](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/), both a full-length and one-act! All female cast.

>*The Night Witches of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment flew in planes made of canvas and wood, and they dropped bombs on Germans every 15 minutes through the night to keep their enemy from sleeping. They were constantly being shuffled and moved to perform new duties; mechanics became navigators, navigators became pilots, and pilots became commanders. Nina and Vera have just finished their training as navigators and are moments away from their first combat mission. As they fight their nerves, the women around them use different means of bolstering their spirits, some more successfully than others. But when the time comes, to the sky they must go. Tonight, however, is different than any night they’ve faced before—their enemy has employed a new tactic taking them completely by surprise. Using movement, song and lyrically styled dialogue, we follow these brave women through one fateful evening during the war.*

## [*The Book Women*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/the-book-women)

Available through [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/), full-length, large flexible cast.

>*In the midst of the Great Depression, in a community crushed by the collapse of coal, and isolated by the very mountains they call home, a group of determined librarians take to their horses to reach the people of Eastern Kentucky. With a dedication equal to the US Postal Service, these “Book Women'' deliver more than the books and magazines they carry in their saddlebags. They bring hope. They bring dreams. They bring the promise that if we support one another, tomorrow will be better.*

## [*Codename: White Mouse*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/1995021/codename-white-mouse)

Not yet published, full-length, flexible cast.

>*When the Germans invade France, Nancy, a rich socialite house wife, isn’t able to sit back and do nothing. Despite her husband's objections, she gets involved with the resistance. For Nancy it’s a slippery slope and soon she graduates from delivering letters to breaking men out of concentration camps. Forced to flee the country with the Gestapo and Vichy on her heals, she is lead to safety over the Pyrenees Mountains. Nancy, however, isn’t satisfied with a quiet life back in England and requests quickly to be sent back into the fight.*

## [*Hear Us Roar*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/3193750/hear-us-roar)

Brand new! Not yet published, full-length, large cast.

>*Hawthorne University's club water polo team has just got earth shattering news: this is their last year, because next year their club team will become women's varsity! Elation doesn't even cover it. This means funding and support; buses and team suits! But, it also means growing pains. Not all the players from the club team will be asked to join varsity. And while they gain women's varsity water polo, other athletic programs are lost. Set in the late 90's, when women's varsity water polo saw a nation wide explosion after it was announced that women's water polo would be played in the 2000 Summer Olympics for the first time in history. This play is a love letter to the game, and the players who put all their heart, soul, grit, and moxie into it. GO LIONS!*

All of the above play titles are linked to where you can find or buy the script. Go read them! Get to know these incredible humans.
