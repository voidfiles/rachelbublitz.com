title: Headed To The Wyoming Theater Festival Later This Month!
---

Last month my family and I moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, which was both exciting and terrifying, but has the benefit of being closer to different places. One of those being Wyoming! I met the Artistic Director of the [Wyoming Theater Festival](http://www.wyomingtheaterfestival.com/), DannyLee Hodnett, at my first Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival Conference up in Washington State in 2015. Now that I'm within driving distance to the festival, he's invited me up for a few days, to see the shows, meet the theater people he's gathered from across the country, teach a workshop (eeeee!), and have a reading of one of my plays! How can I, as a sane playwright, turn that down? Obviously, I can't. 

Watch out Wyoming, I'm headed your way.
