Beyond thrilled and over-joyed to announce that *Burst* was named a *finalist*(!!!!!) for the [National New Play Network](http://nnpn.org/)'s 2022 Showcase! This was my first year I was able to have a play considered, you need an NNPN theater to nominate your work (shout-out and huge thank you to Alicia Washington and Camille Washington at [Good Company Theatre](https://www.goodcotheatre.com/) for putting *Burst* forward!), and I am flabbergasted to have made it so far. What is also flooring me is the other finalists! What a mighty group to be included in! I cannot wait to read and/or see these plays:

Still working hard on getting *Burst* out there for a world premiere production, or, my secret dream, a [Rolling World Premiere](http://nnpn.org/programs/rolling-world-premieres/) with NNPN! I encourage you to give it a read! Pass it on to any theater artist you think would have an interest in it. I would appreciate it to the moon and back!
