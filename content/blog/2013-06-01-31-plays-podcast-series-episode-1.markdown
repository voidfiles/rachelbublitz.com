*There is language that may be offensive in this podcast.

I am very excited that my play *How Terry Gross Destroyed My Life* was given so much life by the talented Sunil Patel (director), [Siobhan Doherty](http://siobhanmariedoherty.com/) (playing Jill), [Claire Rice](http://claireannrice.blogspot.com/) (playing Helen), and [Melissa Keith](https://www.facebook.com/melissakeithactor?fref=ts) (reading stage directions).

Also big thanks to our sound geniuses, [Thomas Kessinger](https://twitter.com/xThomasx) and Taylor Gonzalez. 

Enjoy!!
