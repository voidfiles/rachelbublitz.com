title: Production of GHOST STORY in November!
---

I got the *best* email this morning! [Love Creek Productions](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Love-Creek-Productions/58978756369?fref=ts), located on the other side of the country in Long Island, will be producing my short play GHOST STORY next month! They accept on going submissions of plays with good roles for women under 25 pages. I submitted during this past binge, so driving myself nuts for a month submitting 30 plays has already paid off! Plus, it was a mail in submission! This gives me faith it's worth it to mail things out. I'm excited, this will be my third production!

Dates and location will be announced as soon as they are confirmed, so stay tuned! And if you're in the neighborhood be sure and check out the show!
