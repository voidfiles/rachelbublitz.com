2019 keeps getting more interesting and I'm delighted to announce that in
February, 2019 I'll be headed to Eugene, Oregon for the [Kennedy Center’s
American College Theatre Festival (KCACTF) Region 7 Conference](http://kcactf7.org/) as a guest
artist! I’ve attended this very conference as a grad student three times before,
and I’ve meet some of my favorite collaborators, as well as some incredible
mentors. It’s wild and amazing that I get to turn around and join the fun as
one of their guest artists, but that’s not all!....

Throughout my week at the conference I’ll get to develop my brand new play [RED
DAYS](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232234/red-days) through their Dramaturgy through Design program! And and and I’ll be
responding to new plays and teaching a workshop or two! It’s like a dream
playwright vacation, really.

Huge thank you to KCACTF Region 7’s New Play Program Chair, [Benjamin Gonzales](https://newplayexchange.org/users/13558/benjamin-gonzales),
for thinking of me! February can’t come soon enough… See you soon Eugene!

Happy Tuesday everyone!
