title: 'After Party For 24 Hour Playfest #24hourfest'
---

There has been a slight change of plans for [Playwright's Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/)'s 24 Hour Playfest (coming up on the 15th of September). Instead of two shows, they've opted for one show plus an after party! There will be refreshments for sale, as well as a raffle! 

I'm thinking I might just bake one of my delicious cherry pies for the raffle, so it's an event you cannot afford to miss. Plus, you know... See all the wonderful work too. This event is going to sell out for sure now. I *highly* recommend buying your tickets ASAP!

That is all.
