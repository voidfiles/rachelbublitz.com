Last month I was kept *pretty* busy with teaching, writing/rewriting [*FUNNY, LIKE AN ABORTION*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion), speaking in three different University of Utah theatre classes, opening [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) at [Good Company Theatre](https://www.goodcotheatre.com/), submissions, and living life in general (which is mostly shuttling my kids to/from school and/or swimming).

All of this to say.... I was not very active on [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard). However, I did manage to write one for [Claire Rice](https://newplayexchange.org/users/23943/claire-rice)'s historical play [*THE EFFECT OF ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/320979/effect-ultraviolet-light), about [Roger Arliner Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Arliner_Young), the first African American woman to receive a doctorate degree in zoology in the United States. Here's my recommendation:

>"Poetic and visceral. I love historical work that feels urgent and immediate, and Rice achieves this with this play. The script also is a gift to designers, Rice leaves space for so much creativity and collaboration in developing the world and the control loss experienced by Roger Arliner Young. Read it!!!"

Hoping to read/see more plays this October, fingers crossed I can make that happen! In the meantime, go and check out [Claire Rice's work on the New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/users/23943/claire-rice)! She has comedies, horrors, horror comedies, physiological thrillers, and more! AND, if you're in the Bay Area, be sure to check out her play *LET'S KILL JESSICA*, which just opened with [Awesome Theatre](https://awesometheatre.org/), playing at [PianoFight](https://www.pianofight.com/) in San Francisco on Thursday nights.
