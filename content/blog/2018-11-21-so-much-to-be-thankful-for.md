+++

2018, so far, has been an amazing year, a year full of more... I've gotten to travel *more* for writing than any other year before going to San Francisco (twice!), Spokane, Chicago, Detroit, and New York City next month. I've had my work performed *more* this year than any other, with the world premiere of [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119869/cheerleaders-vs-aliens), four productions (and one reading!) of my ten-minute play [*MY BODY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2541/my-body) both here in the states as well as one international production, readings heaped upon readings of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) across the country, and tons and tons of other performances of my other work ([all laid out here, if you're curious!](https://rachelbublitz.com/2018/11/09/a-calendar-year-full-of-public-performances/)). I've sent out *more* submissions this year so far than ever before, with over 500 so far. I've gotten a lot *more* finalist notifications, and *more* requests for scripts from samples I've sent out. AND, I've gotten to know a lot *more* wonderful artists from all over, the best benefit from all the travel by far has been expanding my community of collaborators. 

I am so thankful for all of this. 

I'm thankful for the ways I've grown this year as an artist, all the above listed opportunities I've had (and for all of those not listed too!), and so much more. I'm thankful for the time I've had to develop my craft further, and for having an incredibly supportive husband, and two demanding but also understanding kids. I'm thankful for my in-laws and my family, who've both taken so many turns watching said demanding kids. I'm thankful to all those collaborators out there, both new and familiar, both local and far away, for wanting to make art with me, and for wanting to help me develop my work. 

My heart is so full. I am so honored.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

I hope this week you have the opportunity to break bread with the people you love.

Happy Thanksgiving!
