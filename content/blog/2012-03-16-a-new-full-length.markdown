title: A New Full Length
---

I've been working on a new full length play for the past month and a half. I feel very confident in Act I, it's another story for Act II and Act III. But that's what rewriting is for, no? 

It's about a woman who wants a child but can't physically have children. Her younger sister gets pregnant on accident and comes to her to take care of her. I don't have a title just yet, but I've been mulling over "My Sister's Baby." 

If anyone wants to take a look, I love to get notes! Shoot me an email.
