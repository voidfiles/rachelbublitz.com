title: The White Snake
---

Tomorrow night I'm seeing [The White Snake](http://www.berkeleyrep.org/season/1213/6331.asp) at [Berkeley Rep](http://www.berkeleyrep.org/index.asp), and I am officially excited. I've heard amazing things about the play, AND I was lucky enough to catch [Mary Zimmerman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Zimmerman)'s [The Arabian Nights](http://www.amazon.com/Arabian-Nights-Play-Mary-Zimmerman/dp/0810120941) a few years back... It blew my mind. One of the finest nights of theatre for me. It's also just been extended through December 30th! So you still have over a month to check it out. I will have my full report on Friday. Until then, stay dry and warm.
