title: ASSASSINS tonight
---

Ever had a day when you just don't feel like doing all the things you are supposed to be doing? Welcome to my week. It's like a crazy procrastination bug I caught or something. So, instead of going to scene night in the city, I'm playing hooky. I'm heading over to the preview of [Shotgun Players'](http://www.shotgunplayers.org/) preview of ASSASSINS. I will be back with a full report tomorrow... That is if I feel like it.
