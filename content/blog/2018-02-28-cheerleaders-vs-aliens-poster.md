The [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) production of *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*, directed by [Alicia Washington](https://www.goodcotheatre.com/) runs May 10th at 7pm, May 11th at 7pm, and May 12th at 2pm and 7pm, and [TICKETS ARE ON SALE NOW](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/index.php?option=com_holdmyticket&view=event&id=299374).

We have our first rehearsal soon, if I wasn't so busy with a million other things I'd be going crazy waiting to get into the room with my actors. Get your tickets as soon as you can, because from what I know about these shows is that they always sell out!

Yay!
