title: Box Office Babe Fill In
---

Busy tonight? If not, be sure and come on down to the [Exit Theatre](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=exit+theatre+san+francisco&fb=1&gl=us&hq=exit+theatre&hnear=0x80859a6d00690021:0x4a501367f076adff,San+Francisco,+CA&cid=0,0,18375594986431938264&ei=WUfKUJDDLqS8iwLA3IGYCw&ved=0CLABEPwSMAM) for tonight's [SF Olympians](http://www.sfolympians.com/) show. I'm filling in for Tracy (read all about the festival from her perspective here on the [box office babe's blog](http://sfolympians2012.blogspot.com/2012/12/welcome-to-official-photo-blog-for-2012.html)). Here's the line up for tonight: Tethys or In The Deep by Meghan Kathleen Oâ€™Connor, and Demeter or In the Silence of Tangerine Groves by Patricia Milton. 

I'll be wearing a very frilly dress (the box office babe traditionally dresses up!)... And since one of the plays is about Demeter, goddess of the harvest, my dress is brown and has flowers. 

Its $10 at the door, and worth every penny. Be there or be square!
