Happy December! Happy Hanukkah! Happy last month of the year!

And as it's the beginning of the month, time to check in on those #SubmissionMission numbers for November.....

November was pretty slow submission wise for me. I was up to my eyeballs in all sorts of other deadlines and so for 2018 it's my lowest month so far. The number of scripts I got sent out this month is... 14. Like I warned, pretty low. BUT, adding that to my 2018 total so far I'm up to 546 submissions in this record-breaking year! 

If I can get 54 scripts out this month I will hit 600 submissions, and that's going to be a challenge since I'll be in New York City exploring for one of the weeks, and hanging with family (and hopefully taking a computer-free break) for two of the other weeks. Can I get out 55 submission in between all that? I really have no idea, but I'm all for trying.

Cross your fingers for me!
