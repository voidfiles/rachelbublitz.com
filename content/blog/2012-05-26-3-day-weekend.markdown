title: 3 Day Weekend
---

Three day weekend! Actually, for a stay at home mom, three day weekends typically equal more work, but I get to sleep in slightly. A bit of a wash really.

Anyway, this weekend I'll be in the thick of my rewrite for "The Fantasy Club," submitting some short plays to festivals, and working on The 31 Plays in 31 Days Project. I need to get the website information written, and make clear what we are offering to playwrights and what we expect in return. What else? Oh yes! Going to closing night of Sheherezade XII! Excited to share the show with my in-laws who will join me this evening.

What are your plans? Seeing any shows?
