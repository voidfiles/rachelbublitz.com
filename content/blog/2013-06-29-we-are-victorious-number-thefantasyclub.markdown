The kickstarter campaign is over, and we made it! Isn't that wonderful? I think so. We raised $4,376! We had 90 backers! Thank you Elizabeth Flanagan (one of our last minute donors). 

Thank you to everyone who donated, and thank you to everyone who shared our project! Because of you lovely folks, *The Fantasy Club* WILL be produced! There are only 34 days until opening night! And tickets go on sale on Monday.

Thank you again!
