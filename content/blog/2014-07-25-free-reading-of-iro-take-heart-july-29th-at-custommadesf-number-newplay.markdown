Earlier this year [Custom Made Theatre](custommade.org) commissioned a new play from me for their reading series, and THIS TUESDAY it's all coming together! I hope that you will join me in the first public reading of *Iro, Take Heart*, the story of a might little girl and her quest to find the great winged horse Pegasus. 

I have [Daunielle Rasmussen](http://theaterforthemasses.wordpress.com/about/) as my director, and my wonderful cast includes: Kim Saunders, Ron Tablot, Katie Robbins, Devin O'Brien, Justine Marler, and Cara McQuillen.

Reading is this TUESDAY (7/29) at 8pm, at [1620 Gough St, SF](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Gough+Street+Playhouse/@37.788465,-122.425195,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xa7475872d63891d1).
