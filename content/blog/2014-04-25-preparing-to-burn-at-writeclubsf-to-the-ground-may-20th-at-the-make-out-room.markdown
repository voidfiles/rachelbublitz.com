The topics have been announced! Come on down to the [Make-Out Room](http://www.makeoutroom.com/) Tuesday, May 20th and see my [Write Club SF](http://writeclubsf.com) debut! My topic is fire folks, and I'm going to bring it (not literal fire, literary fire).

Here's the full line-up:

[Ian Edwards](http://ianeds.wordpress.com/) with BEGINNING vs [Amy Bell](http://www.amykbell.com/) with END

Rachel Bublitz with FIRE vs Shobha Rao with WATER

[Steven Westdahl](http://twitter.com/swestdahl) with GEMINI vs [Casey Childers](http://apeinfinitum.net/) with GEMINI

Again, that's May 20th (a TUESDAY) at 8pm! Come, watch, drink, cheer!
