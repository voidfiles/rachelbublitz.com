title: Babies The Ultimate Birth Control Rehearsal
---

Last night I was lucky enough to witness rehearsal for mine and [Tracy Held Potter](https://www.facebook.com/TracyHeldPotter)'s  upcoming [SF Fringe](http://www.sffringe.org/) show [BABIES, The Ultimate Birth Control](https://www.facebook.com/events/158170084370589/)! Lucky because I am busy now all the time.

It was SO good. It was *SO* funny! I can't wait for the show opens on September 7th! Everyone will be rolling in their seats with laughter and then immediately stock piling condoms. 

Here are all the dates and performances:

SATURDAY September 7 4:00 PM

SATURDAY September 14 9:00 PM 

SUNDAY September 15 1:00 PM

TUESDAY September 17 9:00 PM

If I were you, I would buy my tickets ASAP! They'll be going fast.
