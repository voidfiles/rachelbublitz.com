Which puts me at - OH MY GOD! - *EIGHTY* recommendations on the New Play Exchange last month! Woo! I read 65 shorts, 3 one-acts, and 12 full-length plays. Daaaaaaang!

Fingers crossed I end up earning a button, but just reading all these plays has been more than enough for me. What a fantastic month! Thanks for the challenge National New Play Exchange, it's been incredibly inspiring!
