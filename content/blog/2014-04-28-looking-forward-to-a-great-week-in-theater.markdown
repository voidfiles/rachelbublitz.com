title: Looking Forward To A Great Week In Theater!
---

Mondays are great when you have a week full of awesome to look forward to. Check *this* guys...

Wednesday I get to hear a first draft of my still-not-titled Pegasus play out loud for the first time! I'm presenting it as my final project for my MFA Playwright Workshop Class, and I'm still pretty proud that I got a first draft of it out this semester (considering I started writing it in February!).

Friday night I'm seeing *August: Osage County* by Tracy Letts at the Contra Costa Civic Theatre (for more info/tickets go here: [http://www.ccct.org/shows-august.html](http://www.ccct.org/shows-august.html)). 

Saturday afternoon I'm seeing *The Suit* at ACT ([http://www.act-sf.org/home/box_office/mainstage/the_suit.html](http://www.act-sf.org/home/box_office/mainstage/the_suit.html)), and Saturday night I'm seeing *Rat Girl* ([http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/577015](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/577015))!

Be jealous, it's okay, it's a pretty awesome line-up. What are you planning to see this week?
