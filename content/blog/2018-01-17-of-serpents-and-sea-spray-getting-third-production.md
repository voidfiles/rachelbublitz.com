Great news! *OF SERPENTS & SEA SPRAY* will be getting a third production come this April! [DannyLee Hodnett](http://www.sheridan.edu/faculty/dannylee-hodnett/), artistic director of the [Wyoming Theater Festival](http://www.whitneyarts.org/about-us/2017-festival-lineup/), and theater professor at [Sheridan College](http://www.sheridan.edu/) will direct the play for Sheridan College's Spring show. I'm so excited that Iro and Annika are coming back to fight another day, and to have their adventures in a whole new state! Trying to figure out if I'll be able to make the trip up to Sheridan to see the production, which might have a slightly tweaked script... More information with specific dates and cast is on its way, be sure to check back for updates!
