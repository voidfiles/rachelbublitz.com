###[Best of PlayGround 17](https://www.facebook.com/events/147684755407289/?ref=2) May 9th - 26th

[PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/) each year challenges playwrights in it's writers pool to write ten minute plays in short periods of time. Throughout the year, the writers are given a topic and only a few days to complete a script. The top scripts are given staged readings during Monday Night Playground. From those scripts, they select 6 to be given a full production and that is what the Best of PlayGround is! This year they've put together an excellent show, it's not to be missed!

This year's selected plays/playwrights are:

*Symmetrical Smack-Down* by [William Bivins](http://www.williambivins.com/), directed by [Jim Kleinmann](http://www.blogger.com/profile/17392188259045849584)

*Value Over Replacement* by Ruben Grijalva, directed by [Katja Rivera](https://twitter.com/katja_rivera)

Sarah Ruhl's *Eurydice* is back, and this time it's in the east bay. You don't always get the opportunity to compare so closely what two separate companies will do with the same text, and here's the perfect chance! Custom Made Theatre Co.'s production just closed, and if you made it out to see it, get your tickets now for DMT's show and see how different the same set of words can be!

Directed by Susan E. Evans. Tickets range from $21 - $29 . [Buy tickets here](http://www.dmtonline.org/eury.html).
