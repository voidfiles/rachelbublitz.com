I got some good news today! My ten-minute play THE HAPPINESS GAP, originally written for [PlayGround](playground-sf.org)'s Math Night, has been selected for [Stonington Player](http://www.stoningtonplayers.org/)'s Tables and Chairs VII! Where are the Stonington Players you ask? Well they're over in Stonington Connecticut.

Performances for Tables and Chairs VII are Nov. 14, 15, 16 & 21, 22! If you're in the area you should check it out and report back to me!
