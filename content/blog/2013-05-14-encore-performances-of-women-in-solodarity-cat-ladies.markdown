title: 'Encore Performances of Women In Solodarity: Cat Ladies'
---

Excellent news this morning! [All Terrain Theater](http://allterraintheater.org/) has added *two* encore performances of their hit showcase Women In Solodarity: Cat Ladies! The shows will be at the same location, a house in Berkeley (for the address you must buy tickets!), and the dates are Monday June 10th, and Tuesday June 11th! The show will be on sale soon, be on the look out because the whole run sold out in a snap the last time!
