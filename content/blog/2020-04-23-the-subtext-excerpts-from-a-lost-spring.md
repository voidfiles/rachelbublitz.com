The days are long and the days are weird. I know yesterday and today I've spent trying to climb out of giant sad hole in the ground, while trying to stay SO positive to help my kids climb out of their sad holes and it's just hard. But, even with the sad holes, there are a number of bright spots along the way... And one of those was just published today...

[The Subtext](https://www.americantheatre.org/category/audio/the-subtext/), a podcast from [American Theatre](https://www.americantheatre.org/), by playwright [Brian James Polak](https://newplayexchange.org/users/724/brian-james-polak), in which Brian interviews playwrights, took a different approach this month. Brian tracked down canceled shows and used this month's episode to shine a light on them. The world premiere of the full-length version of *THE NIGHT WITCHES* was canceled, like so many other shows, and I am really proud to have a monologue from it in this episode. Abigail Knighton is my actor, who would have played the role of Marta in the premiere had it gone on, and she was directed by the intended director of the production, Alexandra Harbold. It is so amazing to help boost up artists, and I appreciate it so much it may bring on tears anyway... Seems my emotions will not be thwarted. Anyway.....
