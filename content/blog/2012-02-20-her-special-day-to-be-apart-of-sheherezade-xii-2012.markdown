title: '"Her Special Day" is Getting PRODUCED!'
---

Fantastic news! I found out that my short play "Her Special Day" will join the line up of Sheherezade XII:2012! Sheherezade is a benefit show for Playwright's Center of San Francisco produced by Wily West Productions. "Her Special Day" will be directed by Kat Kneisel.

I am extremely excited, this will be the very first production of one of my plays. We have auditions this weekends and rehearsals begin in April. The show will run for three weekends in May. I will be posting dates and ticket info as soon as I have it, so stayed tuned!
