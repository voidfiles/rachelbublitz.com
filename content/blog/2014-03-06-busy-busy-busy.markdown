This funny thing keeps happening to me, I'll be in the middle of a week and just slammed with work, and I'll think to myself, "Don't worry about it, next week things will calm down." And the thing is, they're not. I've been telling myself that for over a month now, and the stuff keeps on coming. Taking on two commissions at once I think might be fueling that... Also I can't even look at *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* without losing half a day or more. And submitting like a mad-woman certainly doesn't help... And, you know, *grad* school and *kids*, and all that... But I'm here to say that even though I'm obscenely busy, I'm having a good time. I'm also here to say that I won't be posting every weekday, like normal. I need to step back a bit from blogging so that I don't rip my hair out in frustration.

I won't be gone completely, so don't fret. In fact, check back tomorrow! I have a blog all thought out and everything, recommending shows that are playing now, or will be opening soon. So check back for my theater picks, and don't worry if I'm not posting... I'm writing and submitting, writing and submitting, all the time.
