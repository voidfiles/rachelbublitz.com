ONE night only, tomorrow, Saturday August 25th at 8pm don't miss out on [Rose Exposed: Breaking News](https://artsaltlake.org/production/rose-exposed-breaking-news/) at the [Rose Wagner Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rose+Wagner+Performing+Arts+Center/@40.7632117,-111.8956481,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x1c0bec6b46008e67!8m2!3d40.7632117!4d-111.8956481) downtown Salt Lake! 

My short play [*THE FINAL DEBATE*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/206537/final-debate), directed by [Jennifer A. Kokai](https://newplayexchange.org/users/2116/jennifer-kokai) and produced by [Plan-B Theatre](https://planbtheatre.org/), has an AMAZING cast (Dee-Dee Darby-Duffin,
Katie Jones Nall & Isabella Reeder), and will kick off the evening. The whole line-up will feature music from the [Gina Bachauer International Piano Foundation](https://www.bachauer.com/), and additional new short works from [PYGmalion Theatre Company](http://pygmalionproductions.org/), [Repertory Dance Theatre](https://www.rdtutah.org/), [Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company](https://ririewoodbury.com/), and [SB Dance](http://www.sbdance.com/)! We will also be joined on stage by pianist [Koji Attwood](https://www.youtube.com/user/Thracozaag), who will play throughout the evening! It's a knock-out line-up and I hope you can make it out.

[Grab your tickets here or at the door](https://arttix.artsaltlake.org/single/SelectSeating.aspx?p=21724)!

Happy one last day until the weekend!
