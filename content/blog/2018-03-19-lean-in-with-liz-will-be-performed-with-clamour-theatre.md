Next month my ten-minute play [*LEAN IN WITH LIZ!*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/62085/lean-liz) will join four other short plays for an evening of new short work at [Clamour Theatre Company](http://clamourtheatre.org/index.htm)! Clamour Theatre Company is located in Fleming Island, Florida, and the reading is set for Friday, April 27th- which oddly enough is the day I head over to Detroit for the reading of [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) with the [Detroit New Works Festival](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/playwriting-opportunities/newworks/). This will be the third time *LEAN IN WITH LIZ!* has been performed in Florida, and I'm so excited for a new audience to see my play. The full line-up with Clamour Theatre Company is:

* *A WOMB WITH A VIEW* by [Rich Orloff](http://richorloff.com/)
* *LEAN IN WITH LIZ!* by Rachel Bublitz
* *MISSED CONNECTIONS* by [Marj O'Neill-Butler](http://marjoneill-butler.com/)
* *GRAM SCAMS* by [Cary Pepper](http://www.carypepper.com/)
* *DEAD GIVEAWAY* by [Daniel Guyton](http://www.danguyton.com/)

Happy Monday everyone!
