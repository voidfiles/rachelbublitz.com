I have two brand new plays burning holes in my head, and a third in need of a page-one rewrite. Oddly enough, they're all on the bit of the twisted side...

I'm starting with my rewrite and tackling *The Summer I Howled*, which I haven't worked on since 2019. My creepy yet comical camp werewolf play for teen performers has me scratching my head a LOT. Not only by my choices and pacing, but I also left all sorts of notes without a shred of context.... Thanks, past Rachel! But I still love the story, and the characters, and I think I'm just about ready to jump in and rework - or completely scrap and rewrite - this play! As a bonus I finally think I've figured out the timing of things! Maybe it's good I haven't touched it in two years! I'm planning to up the flexibility of the cast, with plenty of doubling and characters that can be played by any gender.

After *The Summer I Howled* I have a prom murder mystery simmering on my brain's back burner just *begging* me to start. It will also be intended for young performers, with a cast of 13. Right now I think the title will be *Blood & Sequins*. I am having a ton of fun reading classic murder mysteries right now to get inspired.

Finally, the next play on my brain stove is another history. But, unlike [*The Book Women*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/products/the-book-women) or [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches) the focus of the story won't be on pilots, or librarians, but instead on criminals. Alice Diamond ran the girl-gang the 40 Elephants that terrorized London, and stole everything they could get their hands on along the way. This play, which doesn't have a title quite yet, will also be for school-aged performers, and will finish up my trio of creep-tastic new plays for young performers.

I'm hoping to complete the trio before December, and start sending out drafts of each, respectively, as they are available. I will post about each play as a new draft is ready, and put those all up on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz)! Be sure to check back here for updates, or email me directly to get on the first-to-know list: [Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com).

Happy Monday! And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a *lot* of writing to do...
