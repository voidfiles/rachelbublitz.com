This may be the year of rewrites, but, since I chose to be a writer, perhaps *all* my years will forever be years of rewrites. Good thing rewrites are the best!

I have many a play to tackle this year with rewrites, and so far I have two under my belt: [*FUNNY, LIKE AN ABORTION*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) and [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst). I'm itching to get in a room with both of these plays with actors and a director, I think they both have so much potential! For now though, I'll be typing away in solitude while I wait the remaining results from last submission season, and continue to submit these two script far and wide.

In other news I have a new title for one of my other full-length plays! *ONCE A SPY* will now forever be called [*CODENAME: WHITE MOUSE*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/48794/codename-white-mouse). It's a switch I've been thinking about for years, and I feel proud that I finally leaped off the cliff and made the change.
