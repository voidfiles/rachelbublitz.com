title: THE FANTASY CLUB, a new draft!
---

I'm currently reworking THE FANTASY CLUB, and I am just so excited about it. I have to get it all polished up to submit with my application to SFSU (I'm applying to join their MFA program next fall). I wrote a brand-spanking-new scene this morning, and it was so much fun. I won't spoil the surprise, it's a bit of a new development.

THE FANTASY CLUB is scheduled to be produced Fall of 2013 through [ALl Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/), so you can come and see what all the fuss is about! In the meantime, I sure hope it's in good enough shape to get me into the program! Keep your fingers crossed for me out there.

PS

Tonight I will actually be seeing ASSASSINS with the [Shotgun Players](http://www.shotgunplayers.org/)! I have tickets and everything.
