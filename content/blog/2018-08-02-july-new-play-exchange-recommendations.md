+++

Summer has been busy for me beyond just a working respect... Having both of my kids home has kept me on my toes. But after my millionth swim practice, I realized something... I could be reading plays and recommending them on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) instead of just staring at my kids swimming in circles. I blame the smell of chlorine that kept me from this obvious answer for so long.

Here's what I got to reading and recommending last month, mostly poolside:
