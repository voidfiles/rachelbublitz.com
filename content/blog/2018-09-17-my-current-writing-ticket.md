+++

My writing ticket is pretty filled up these days. I love it while also wishing for more naps. Such is the life of a writer... Or at least, this writer. I'm like that quintessential image of the angry and drunk male writer, except I will take a blanket over whiskey, making dinner for my kiddos instead of yelling at anyone who enters my writing space, and I am female. Otherwise, it's basically the same.

And I am BUSY with all the letters capitalized. Right now (or *write* now?) I'm working on:

First draft of [*RED DAYS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232234/red-days), a brand new coming-of-age full-length plays about mothers and daughters and air pollution. Hoping to have a first draft by Friday.

New pages for [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst), which I heard yesterday during rehearsal at [Salt Lake Acting Company](https://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/) and am SO in love with. We have our next rehearsal Sunday, so those are due before then.

New draft of my theater for young audiences play for [Plan-B Theatre](https://planbtheatre.org/)'s 2020 school tour, [*PRESENTING: SUPER CAT AND REPTILE ROBOT IN THE TERRIBLE TICKLE TROUBLE*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232233/presenting-super-cat-reptile-robot-terrible-tickle-trouble), which I *just* heard last Saturday in the Playwrights Lab and am still smiling about.

AND a first draft for *NIGHT WITCHES*, which I'm still in the middle of researching.

AND AND coming up: probably tinkers with [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) during the [Problematic Play Festival at Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/problematic) in San Francisco - reading October 13th! And a new new new play that I've been kicking around for two years now.

I think I have it under control. I'll just nap when I'm dead I guess.

Happy Monday and happy writing to all my fellow writers out there!
