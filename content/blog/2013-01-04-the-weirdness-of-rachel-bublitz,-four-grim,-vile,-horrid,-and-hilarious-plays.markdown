###SUNDAY! January 27th, at 7pm, doors open at 6:30pm

This series is free to all Masquers Members and Masquers Season Ticket Holders. General admission is $5. No reservations necessary. 

####*Terrible People*

Doris has returned to her estranged daughter, Lisa, in order to start training her grand-daughter, Nicole, in the art of killing.

####*Horny Like The Wolf*

Officer delivers devastating news to Wife, and is puzzled (to say the least) by her response.

####*Nap Time*

While trying to put Baby down for a nap, Mom is faced with all of her doubts and angst surrounding parenthood. There's a good reason why babies don't talk.

####*Baby Pie*

*Baby Pie* is the result of a nightmare, it floats through different styles of theatre giving the audience a twisted, yet hilarious ride. Mother and Father have lost their darling girl. In her grief Mother goes to all lengths to get her daughter back and by doing so unleashes a terror upon the village.

Okay, mark your calendars! And be warned, if you're not into the violent, grotesque, and strange this may not be a show for you to see!
