title: 2013 SF Olympians Festival Call For Directors
---

The [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) has just posted a call for directors! If you want to get involved with this exciting festival, this is a great way to do it! If you do decide to throw your hat in the ring, you can see what each playwright is planning to write by visiting the [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) website and clicking on the list of characters under the SF Olympians: The Trojan Requiem bar on the right hand side of the page.

Here are all the details from the [San Francisco Olympians Festival facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/San-Francisco-Olympians-Festival/282661841972):

The 2013 San Francisco Olympians Festival: Trojan Requiem is a festival featuring commissioned plays by Bay Area playwrights revolving around The Trojan War. The 12-show festival includes several full-length pieces, extended one-acts, and evenings of short plays based on a similar theme. For more information about the festival, visit [http://www.sfolympians.com](http://www.sfolympians.com/).
 
The SF Olympians Festival is accepting letters of interest from directors between April 1 and April 30, 2013. Please note that as a reading festival, SF Olympians is focused on the playwrights' creation process and the development of new work. Ultimately, directors will be selected and contacted by the individual participating playwrights, not assigned by the Festival. To build our community of directors, we are offering potential directors two ways of engaging with our playwrights: submission of a letter of interest and an invitation to participate in our Directors/Playwrights Mixer on Wednesday, May 8th.
 
To be considered by the 2013 Olympians playwrights, please email the following information with the subject line “Olympians Director – YOUR NAME” to [tracy@allterraintheater.org](mailto:tracy@allterraintheater.org) by midnight on April 30, 2013. Letters of interest will only be accepted by email.
 
Letter of Interest Guidelines:

1. Please provide your name, phone number, and email address.

2. What does new play development mean to you as a director?

3. Are there any topics in this year’s line-up that are particularly exciting to you? OR Why is Greek mythology exciting to you?

4. Have you ever participated in the Olympians Festival before? If yes, please list your involvement.

5. Availability for Important Dates (see below).

6. Your resume (optional).
 
Please do not exceed one page with elements 1-4, and please send all your information as one document (.doc or .pdf). Thank you!
 
In your email to Tracy, please include the line: “I understand that directing a reading in the festival is a volunteer project.”
 
Directors/Playwrights Mixer, Wed, May 8, 2013

Participation in this event is not required
