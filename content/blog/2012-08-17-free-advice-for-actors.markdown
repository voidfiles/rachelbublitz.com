title: Free Advice For Actors
---

Last night I went to an especially engaging scene night over with the folks at [Playwright's Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/). The actors were spot on, and the interesting thing is that two of those actors I'd seen days before at an audition and neither had blown me away. So, here's my advice to all you actors out there: Find and attend scene nights. It's a great way to get to know new playwrights and for them to see your versatility. I think the hardest part of acting is cold reading, so you'd be developing an important skill while you network. Win win! Okay, that's all really.... Got it? Good.
