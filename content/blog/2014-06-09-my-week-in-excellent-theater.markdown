title: 'My Week in Excellent Theater: PEN/MAN/SHIP @MagicTheatre, MUTT @impacttheatre,
  and CRUCIBLE @CustomMadeSF '
---

Last week I saw three, yes *three* excellent plays; *PEN/MAN/SHIP* at [Magic Theatre](http://magictheatre.org/), *Mutt* at [Impact Theatre](http://www.impacttheatre.com/), and *The Crucible* at [Custom Made Theatre Co.](http://www.custommade.org/). All were incredibly well done. It was also a nice mix; two dramas, one comedy, two new plays, one classic, two of the productions had actors I know and love, and one had brand new faces for me to get to know. But there were also choices that all the plays made, as if the directors had gotten together and had a huddle before their respective productions, and this was clearest in the transitions. Each play created theatrical space with their transitions as opposed to just having a table moved, or props struck. This is a trend I hope to see more of, because they made such strong choices to fill that space my mind instead of it's normal wandering during scene changes, was brought *more* into the play, building my curiosity, fear, making me laugh, or breaking my heart. All three of these shows are also ONES THAT YOU SHOULD NOT MISS! And lucky for you, you still have a shot at seeing them....

*PEN/MAN/SHIP* by [Christina Anderson](http://newdramatists.org/christina-anderson) directed by [Ryan Purcell](http://www.ryanpurcelldp.com/dp/contact_-.html), which breaks open the ugly side of people and leaves the audience asking hard questions of itself. It is a deceivingly simple, like a great meal from your favorite restaurant that no matter how many times you try, you are unable to recreate at home. And, AND, it's playing until June 15th! In fact it plays Tuesday the 10th until Sunday the 15th giving you seven opportunities more to see it (it plays twice on Wednesday the 11th).

*Mutt* by [Christopher Chen](http://www.christopherchen.org/) directed by [Evren Odcikin](http://www.odcikin.com/) has you laughing from the start. It is hilarious, and doesn't hold back any punches, making fun of Republicans and Democrats alike. *Mutt* is playing also until the 15th, running Thursday-Sunday. So only FOUR chances left to hear the wonderful Michelle Taglarow say: "That's the power of being hapa." So make the time. Get your tickets!

And, last but not least, *The Crucible* by Arthur Miller directed by [Stuart Bousel](http://www.horrorunspeakable.com/). I'm one of those rare theater birds that had never seen *The Crucible* before, and so this was extra special for me. While *The Crucible* wasn't the first play I read, it was among the first ten, and when I was a young girl I did a obsess-over-the-Salem-witch-trials stint. The pacing of the show was incredible, moving so quickly and powerfully that I felt myself getting caught up in the fervor. And those few moments when time seems to stop in the play, broke my heart. The *sixteen* actors (who says you can't do large casts, anymore?) that make up the cast completely blew me away. I cried, I was scared, and I was proud of all the fine work my fellow artists put in on this production. *The Crucible* has been extended until June 22nd (!) and so you still have eight more chances to see it. Don't be sad that you missed this show, really, just don't do that to yourself.

You have your orders, go and see *PEN/MAN/SHIP*, *Mutt*, and *The Crucible*. No ifs, ands, or buts, just do it! Seriously. You can thank me later.
