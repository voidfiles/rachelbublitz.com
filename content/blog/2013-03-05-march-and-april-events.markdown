>The Exit Theater announces a new Saturday night monthly event in their Café- and an exciting new collaboration with the San Francisco Theater Pub! 

>Starting March 23rd, every third Saturday of the month, we invite writers, actors, directors, theater creators and theater audiences alike to an evening of quick script-making and flash-fried performance!

>Join us for an 8:30 mixer followed by a 9:00 writing sprint where writers (any writers who care to participate that night) have 30 minutes to generate original monologues based around that night's pre-selected subjects (will they be drawn from a hat? WHO CAN SAY?!?). We cast actors from the crowd (no experience necessary), then at 9:30, they perform the work on stage in the café for an on-the-spot, one-night-only instant festival! Come join in the communal creativity, either as writer, performer, or audience!

>Hosted by local writers [Stuart Bousel](http://dramalist.com/people/2774/stuart-bousel/author/director/actor) and [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/), admission to this event is free, with the Café staying open and staffed so you can purchase drinks and snacks all night long! No need for reservations! We'll provide paper and pens, all you need to bring is your amazing, sexy mind and the desire to create for creation's sake. 

>See you there! 

>And definitely, definitely, pass this notice along!

####No Nude Men Productions present [Behind the Curtain: Three Backstage Plays by Three San Francisco Writers](https://www.facebook.com/events/207741732701115/?ref=2)

No Nude Men Productions, in association with the [The Exit Theater](http://www.theexit.org/web/), presents a one weekend only min-festival of three dramatic readings exploring what it's like to make theater via the tried and true lens of the backstage comedy. 

On Thursday, March 28, at 8 PM…

INTRIGUE! 19TH CENTURY GOSSIP! ALIENS! *In The Wings*, by Meghan O’Connor, brings you backstage of a theater that was bold and bored enough to put on an obscure, deceased man's only play. This play is a two-for-one: you enjoy all the gripping drama on the stage, and all the shenanigans that go on in the wings. And there is an alien invasion to boot! Directed by Meghan O’Connor featuring Vince Faso, Tonya Narvaez

On Friday, March 29, at 8 PM…

America is in a financial crisis. Republicans are accusing the president of being a communist. And young women are worried about their futures, their love lives, and their place in the world. Welcome to Vassar College, 1934. *In The Rose of Youth* by [Marissa Skudlarek](http://marissabidilla.blogspot.com/), a drama department production of Antony and Cleopatra changes the lives of everyone who works on it: its formidable director, Hallie Flanagan; its male lead, Professor Gordon Post; and, especially, its leading lady, college senior Kalita Humphreys. Directed by Marissa Skudlarek, featuring Patrick Barresi, Jonathan Brooks, Alisha Ehrlich, Travis Howse, Paul Jennings, Jan Carty Marsh, Theresa Miller , Leer Relleum 

On Saturday, March 30, at 8 PM…

*Pastorella*, by [Stuart Bousel](http://dramalist.com/people/2774/stuart-bousel/author/director/actor), is the tale of a present-day small theater troupe putting on a production of Tom Stoppard's Arcadia. There is the hapless actress fresh out of college and wondering if she should have chosen a different route; the squabbling gay couple who have been upstaging each other ever since they met playing Hamlet and Laertes; the over-bearing diva-in-her-own-mind who is quietly sabotaging (or is it saving?) her commercially successful daughter's career; not to mention the age old question of why people go into theater- and why they stay in it. Directed by Anthony R. Miller, featuring Annika Bergman, John Caldon, Andrew Chung, Jeremy Cole, Allene Hebert, Kate Jones, Charles Lewis III, Anthony Pinggera, Carole Swann, Peter Townley. 

ADMISSION EACH NIGHT IS A MERE $10.00, with half of the door proceeds going to support the EXIT Theatre. 

NO RESERVATIONS NECESSARY
