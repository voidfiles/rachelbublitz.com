title: What Are YOU Doing Monday Night?
---

Mondays are usually slow night on the theatre scene, tomorrow that is not the case. I know of three super fun indie theatre events going down, where will you be at?

First up, put on your most comfortable pajamas and head on down to [Cafe Royale](http://www.caferoyale-sf.com/) for [SF Theatre Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/)'s show [Pajanuary!](https://www.facebook.com/events/536743766345175/).

>Pa-January! – A Night of Bedtime Stories

>The holidays are over but 2013 is now here with a New Year of Theater Pub!

>With winter still ahead of us, we’re inviting everyone to cozy up in Café Royale for a Pajama Party and a night of Bedtime Stories. We’re talking grade-A comfort theater, with stories old and new, a lullaby or two, crayons and coloring and of course booze – just like elementary school!

>This Theater Pub will be brought to you by the Letter T for Talent, including Stuart Bousel, Megan Cohen, Jeremy Cole, Ashley Cowan, Jaime Lee Currier, Sang S. Kim, Dan Kurtz, William Leschber, Carl Luciana, Brian Markley, Jan Marsh, Karen Offereins, Sunil Patel and Marissa Skudlarek. 

>Pajamas are optional but whimsy is not. That said, if you come in your pajamas, we’ll totally enter you in a raffle to win a prize!

>It all happens on January 21st, 2013 at the Cafe Royale in San Francisco! The show starts at 8, but get there early to support our friends the Hide-Away BBQ, who will be bringing pop-up deliciousness! Admission is, as always, free, with a suggested donation at the door!

And I will tell you from experience, the pop up BBQ is delicious.

Next, [Southern Railroad Theatre Company](http://southernrailroadtheatrecompany.blogspot.com/) presents, [RESOLUTIONS: I Do Declare](https://www.facebook.com/events/408548972555512/); staged readings of new short plays by local playwrights.

>You are invited to the Southern Railroad Theatre Company’s 
2013 New Year’s Open House.

>We are proud to present staged readings of new short plays from some of our favorite fellow theatre companies, performed by members of the Southern Railroad Theatre Company and invited guests!

>Join us for a night of New Years Resolutions, 
with just a little taste-of-the-South.

Finally, but certainly not least, and where you'll find me... [Monday Night Playground's Musical Theatre Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/119946558170098/?ref=2). [Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2)'s musical will join tomorrow night's line up, and even thought I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, I am really excited to see what the writers came up with in such a short time! If you didn't know, [SF Playground](http://www.playground-sf.org/) selects a group of up and coming local playwrights each year, and the writers have about a weekend to write a new play after they are handed the topic. Here's some more info:
