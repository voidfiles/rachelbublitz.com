+++

Oh wow, it's July! I don't know how they do this, but having your kids home makes time move super super fast. Which is counterintuitive, because SO often we're playing Sorry or Monopoly or some other long game nearly void of strategy which in my heart I fear will never end. BUT, it's July, and it took all of a snap of a finger for June to end, so apparently time is marching on, and marching at quite a quick pace. I'm getting *very* little work done so far this summer, with all the board games, and ushering to and from swim practices, and zoo trips, and splash pads, but my kids are almost at the awful teenager phase so I'm also kinda loving the time to spend with them when they're not constantly hurling insults my way, so I'm doing my very best to be okay with getting less done.

And speaking of getting less done.... Time to check in on that good ol' #SubmissionMission! Submitting is the *one and only* spot of my job where I haven't completely fallen off the wagon. I'm pretty impressed with my numbers this month, considering I now have two time consuming co-workers running around my office 24/7! 

And so, get that drum roll going...... Those numbers are............. FIFTY ONE! I sent out fifty one scripts for the month of June, bringing my total for 2018 up to *326 submissions*! If I can keep up sending fifty scripts (or more) per month through the rest of the year, I'm going to destroy my #SubmissionMission! 

Thank you to all you wonderful theater artists who keep emailing, tweeting, and facebook messaging me playwriting opportunities you don't want me to miss. Really bolsters my spirit to have so many of you rooting for me out there, and as I try to leave no stone unturned, it's INCREDIBLY helpful! So, thank you, thank you, thank you and keep 'em coming! 

Happy July and happy Monday everyone!!
