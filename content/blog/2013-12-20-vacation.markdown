title: Vacation!
---

Tomorrow my family and I leave for San Diego, the city of my childhood. I can't wait to see mi familia and play the usual reindeer games (Jewish people play reindeer games too). 

I'm going to be taking the rest of the year off from my blog (all less than two weeks of it), so this is it until 2014! Unless I get any great news, that I'll be posting right away.

I hope you have a safe and love-filled holiday(s), and see you next year!r
