title: GARBAGE DISPOSAL is getting produced in New York City
---

My ten minute play *Garbage Disposal* (one of my 31 plays I wrote last August) will be produced by [Thespian Productions](http://www.thespianproduction.com/) this March! *Garbage Disposal* will join their line up for their spring "Theatre Madness" event at [Joria Main Stage Theatre](https://www.google.com/search?q=260+West+36th+St.%2C+3rd+floor%2C+New+York%2C+NY%2C+10018&oq=260+West+36th+St.%2C+3rd+floor%2C+New+York%2C+NY%2C+10018&aqs=chrome.0.57.323&sugexp=chrome,mod=13&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) (the theatre is right next to Penn Station, how cool is that??). 

The show will run March 7th-9th, and it will be preformed twice. Once I know the exact times and other details, I'll let you know!

One of these days, I'm going to have to get out to New York.
