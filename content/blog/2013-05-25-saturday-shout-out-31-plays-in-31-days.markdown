Are you playwright enough?

August is sneaking up fast, have you signed up for [The 31 Plays in 31 Days Project](https://31plays31days.com/)? Last August was out first year and we had over 400 playwrights sing up to write a play a day for the month of August... Guess what, over 100 playwrights did it! This year, we're all set to do the crazy thing again!

Here are the basics about the project:

>"What?
The 31 Plays in 31 Days Project is a chance for playwrights to push themselves to write a new play every day for the month of August. The plays must be a minimum of one page. Are you up for the challenge?

>Why?
The 31 Plays in 31 Days Project is based on the idea that to become a better writer, you must write. You must write a lot. And you need to practice experimenting with your writing form constantly. The pressure of this goal will allow you to set aside preconceived notions of what you should be writing and how you should be doing it. You will not have time to overanalyze your work, you will just have to write, write, write and be surprised by what comes out of you. You may love your work some days and wonder what happened on others, but by the end of the month, you will have amassed 31 new plays. Instead of waiting for the breeze of inspiration to blow your way, you will see that writing is a craft that can be called on at any time.

>When?
August 1st at 12:00 am until August 31st at 11:59pm

>Where?
Anywhere and everywhere!

>Who?
Playwrights who are crazy enough to write 31 Plays in just 31 short days!

>Finally.... How?
[Register here](https://31plays31days.com/). Weâ€™ll send you instructions on how to submit your script daily. Or, you can just write a play a day on your own and not tell us about it! We encourage all participants to comment on their progress often, and their experience throughout the month. If you wish to be eligible for the 31 Plays in 31 Days Podcast Series you must select the daily submission option. We will announce on July 15th the submission procedure, sending out emails to all participating playwrights."

Sign up today, don't delay!
