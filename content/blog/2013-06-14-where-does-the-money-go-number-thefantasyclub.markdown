title: 'Where Does The Money Go? #thefantasyclub'
---

A couple of folks have asked me about money, and why we need it, and where it's going. To that I say, *excellent* question! I asked the artistic director of [All Terrain Theater](http://allterraintheater.org/) *and* director of *The Fantasy Club*, [Tracy Held Potter](https://www.facebook.com/TracyHeldPotter?fref=ts), and this is what she told me:

* Rehearsal & Performance Space Rental: $1800
* Actor Stipends: $1300
* Crew Stipends: $1500
* Insurance: $400

>"This is the basic fees that we're trying to cover through [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz), this is obviously more than $4,000, but we expect ticket sales to cover some of this. Also, Kickstarter itself has fees and providing rewards costs some money, proportional to our campaign's success. For this reason, it would be great to raise at least $6,000, and anything over that helps us fund our next two shows."

As of right now (10:16am in the morning of Friday, June 14th) we are 39% of the way to our base goal of $4,000! We have 14 days to go and need all the help we can get. If you haven't given already, I do hope that you will consider doing so, you can donate as little as $1, and every $1 helps! 

Sharing also helps, so after your fit of laughter subsides, share our project with your friends, if you're tweeting use the hashtag #thefantasyclub!
