title: PROJECT LOHAN
---

Last night I laughed my butt of at ACT's Costume Shop seeing [PROJECT LOHAN](http://www.projectlohan.com/) by [D'Arcy Drollinger](http://www.darcydrollinger.com/darcydrollinger-scalpel.html). The show is incredibly funny, and I loved that except for D'Arcy Drollinger, each actor had about ten different roles to play. The actors were phenominal at this. PROJECT LOHAN starred Michael Patrick Gaffney, [Cindy Goldfield](http://cindygoldfield.wikidot.com/), Sara Moore, Allegra Rose Edwards, [Elizabeth Irene Anderson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027094/), and D'Arcy Drollinger. It was directed by [Tracy Ward](http://www.tracyward.org). The staging was also outstanding. The script, was compiled from interviews, tabloid stories, and footage of Lindsay Lohan, and that was also really well done. There did come a point where it got tremendously repetitive, she gets in a car accident, her father sells an embarrassing tape, rehab, repeat. But, for me, it was as funny as it was sad. After all, this is a life we're laughing at. And there came a point, only made stronger by the words of her awful, disgusting, parents, when I stopped laughing and started to feel sorry for this girl. She's a complete mess, and I don't think anyone has ever given her tools to not be. And that's sad to me. Also watching the play I couldn't help but wonder when we'd hear about her passing away, probably in a drug related incident. Would her parent's still find ways to profit from her death? Unfortunately yes, I think they would. 

To sum up, it's funny until it's tragically sad. It makes me hope with complete sincerity that that woman figures her shit out and gets her life together.
