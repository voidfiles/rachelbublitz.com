I have exciting news! I just booked my first gig for the year 2020. The future is coming, guys. No joke.

I'll be writing for [Plan-B Theatre](http://planbtheatre.org/)'s [Free Elementary School Tour](http://planbtheatre.org/rscm/)! The play will be for kids in 4th through 6th grade, need only two actors, be mobile, and run between 30 and 40 minutes. Oh! And it also needs to have educational tie-in. I am so thrilled! There are so many rules! I love rules! AND I love challenges. This project really seems to have it all. It is also deeply satisfying to know that someone enjoys my work enough to schedule something three years out. So thank you Plan-B Theatre! I sure hope to make you proud!
