title: Emailing Strangers
---

Most of my emails are to people I know, or, when I'm submitting plays, it's to people who've asked for emails from strangers. I'm about to start emailing strangers that did not asked to be emailed at all. I know this is part of being a playwright, writing artistic directors and literary managers and say, "Hi! You don't know me, but I'm awesome, and you should come and see my work," but I am not a huge fan of doing it. I'm sure these people get so many emails a day, and realistically mine will likely only be glanced at once, or deleted right off the bat. Sigh...

BUT! I must be strong. I must be strong for my work. My newest draft of *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* is here and I want the world to know it. I want the world to come and see this play... And, since the world will not fit into the Exit theatre for the reading (November 9th, one night only!) I have to try and convince people with theaters to come and watch the reading and hope that they are blown away and decide they must have *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* at their theater. The odds are against me on this, I'm an unknown playwright, my plays is over two hours, and there are nearly 20 characters in it. BUT! As I said, I must be strong for my work. My work is strong, it's the least I can do in return. So, here we go... Emailing strangers....
