title: Binge Day 16, 30 PLAYS SUBMITTED!
---

30 plays submitted in 16 days! Oy, I should try this every month, just to get me to keep submitting! But, no... Sanity is important, and without breaks, I'm not sure I would stay sane. I found it interesting that this time I submitted a many plays for publishing opportunities, in the past I've mostly sent things in for productions or readings. 

Anyway, here are my last submissions:

Plays 25 and 26 went to the [Independent Actor's Theatre](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.iatheatre.org/2012/call-for-plays-iats-5th-annual-short-womens-play-festival&usd=2&usg=ALhdy28kSNJcy1OYhG9dt1Lh4ZfKeUk0IQ), who are seeking short play (10-12 minutes) by women. I sent them *Horny Like The Wolf*, and *Mother of the Year*. And you can send in TWO to them. Deadline is September 30, 2013.

I sent *My Body* over to [Smith & Kraus](http://www.smithandkraus.com/htdocs/index.php), because I remembered that it was also produced and eligible! If you don't remember, they look for plays throughout the year for publication that have had productions. This was submission #27.

And for my final three submissions, I sent over *Horny Like The Wolf*, *Nap Time*, and *Mother Of The Year* to the [Fine Arts Association](http://www.fineartsassociation.org/theatre/audition.html#OneActPlays) who is taking submissions of 10-minute plays, and will take 3 plays from each playwright. The plays must not have been published. Deadline is October 1, 2013.

And just like that, I'm done! Relieved to be done, because I have a TON of writing going on, and it's nice to focus on that for a bit. I might end up submitting more plays this month, but I'm not going to be posting them here. If truth be told, I wrote more than 31 plays last August. It's a sickness, it really is.

Good luck with your [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/playwrightbinge/info)!
