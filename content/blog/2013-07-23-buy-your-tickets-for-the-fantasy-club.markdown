*The Fantasy Club* by Rachel Bublitz

Join us for a hilarious ride through the mind of Bay Area writer, Rachel Bublitz by supporting All Terrain Theater’s production of “The Fantasy Club.” A stay-at-home-mom herself, Bublitz is known for her strong comedic writing and holds nothing back in this sexy comedy about Frances, a housewife who finds herself in the arms of the man she’s been fantasizing about since high school. Uh-oh! 

This is All Terrain Theater’s fourth season producing original new work in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we’re thrilled to bring this show to The Alcove Theater for six amazing performances between August 2 – 11.
