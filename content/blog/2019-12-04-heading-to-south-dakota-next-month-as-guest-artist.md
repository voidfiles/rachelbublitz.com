I really really love my job. Through playwriting I get to tell all sorts of stories, collaborate with creative and (mostly) wonderful human beings, travel to lots of brand new places, and return to spots I love. In 2019 I went to Eugene, OR, San Francisco, CA again and again and again, Salem, OR (Oregon could not get enough of me in 2019!), Los Angelos, CA, and Davis, CA. I'm really looking forward to all the places writing plays takes me in 2020, and I'm kicking it off with a (most likely) very chilly trip to Sioux Falls, South Dakota next month!

I've been asked to be t a guest artist for the [Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival Conference for Region Five](https://www.kcactf5.org/)! Can't wait to respond to new work by students and participate for the second year in a row in the Collaborative Theatre Challenge! Last year in Region 7 I got to hear and tinker with my play [*RED DAYS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232234/red-days), which was an incredibly rewarding experience. In 2020 I'll be developing my two-hander comedy [*FUNNY, LIKE AN ABORTION*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion)! Can't wait to dig in to this play with a whole bunch of students and artists, in a part of the country I have yet to explore. Very much hoping to cross off all the states in the country one day, having developed work in all of them.

Stay tuned for my adventure to South Dakota! I will be bringing approximately 1,000 pairs of gloves.
