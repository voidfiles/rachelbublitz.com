title: ASSASSINS update
---

As it turns out, I was not meant to see [ASSASSINS](http://www.shotgunplayers.org/2012_assassins.htm) tonight. The show was super sold out, and I was sadly one person past the lucky folks on the wait list that made it in. C'est la vie. So I bought a ticket for a later date, and let me tell you... They might just sell out the entire run. Yes! So, if you want to see it, buy your tickets asap!
