---

What are *you* doing this Monday evening? I'll tell you what you *should* be doing... You should come on over the San Francisco and check out the developmental reading of my full length play MY SISTER'S BABY! It's a comedy about sisters and babies and you will laugh and enjoy yourself, I promise. Plus, I need you feedback! That's what developmental readings are all about, so come and contribute your two scents. Here are all the details:

The Playwright's Center of San Francisco presents a developmental reading of:

MY SISTER'S BABY
a new play by Rachel Bublitz

Sisters are always there for each other: borrowing clothes, giving advice, bearing their sister's children ... wait, what? 

Margaret is devastated that she can't have children. When Julia, her younger sister, gets pregnant accidentally, Margaret makes it her life's mission to convince Julia to have the baby for her.
