title: One Minute Play Festival
---

I had the pleasure of seeing [Playwright's Foundation](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/)'s [One Minute Play Festival](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=227). What a great time! [Dominic Dâ€™Andrea](https://twitter.com/dominicdandrea) was there to introduce the the festival, he is the producing artistic director of [One-Minute Play Festival](http://oneminuteplays.wordpress.com/) and he had some interesting things to say... He talked about how this festival was like talking the pulse of the artists in the city. And I really feel like that's a great way to think of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the show, and I found it incredibly interesting how many of the same themes emerged from these plays... As far as I know the writers weren't given any topics. 

The actors did a great job as well, as did the directors. The transitions between the 70 (yes 70!) plays were snappy and quick... And I was impressed with how much punch the plays could give out within a minute.

The last show was this evening, so if you missed it, you missed it. But it'll be back next year! I'll be going for sure!
