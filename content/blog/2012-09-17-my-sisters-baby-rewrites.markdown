title: MY SISTER'S BABY rewrites
---

Two weeks away from the developmental reading of [MY SISTER'S BABY](https://www.facebook.com/events/420239358038714/)! I can't wait! I have a few days before I have to turn in the script for the reading, so that means I have a few days for rewriting it! The first act is pretty strong, but I need to shuffle and fix the second half. So I have my mellow music on, my kids are destroying the backyard, and I'm typing as fast as my brain and hands will allow.  As challenging as rewriting is for me, it might be my favorite part of writing.
