What a whirlwind weekend down in Cedar City! It was filled with great theater, new friends, delicious food, and pretty epic hiking. I had no idea that the [Utah Shakespeare Festival](https://www.bard.org/) was hiding such wonders; my husband and I are already talking about our next trip down!

AND, because I'm a super lucky playwright, on top of all of that, I *also* got to watch three actors tackle my play [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) in front of an audience for the very first time. The [REACH Cabaret 2018](https://www.facebook.com/REACH-Cabaret-2018-177085979625728/) reading of *BURST* was fantastic. I was blown away by the acting talent, I got to work with [Veronica Otim](https://www.bard.org/bios-2018/veronica-otim), [Daria Redus](https://www.dariapilarredus.com/), and [Isabella Abel-Suarez](https://isabellaabelsuarez.wixsite.com/bella), the [IG Winery](http://www.igwinery.com/), where the reading took place, was a beautiful and cozy spot to watch brand new plays, and I learned a ton about the script; where it's at right now and what it needs.

HUGE and GIANT thank you to [Colleen Baum](https://www.bard.org/bios-2018/colleen-baum), who organized the reading and read stage directions, and to all the actors and artists involved with REACH Cabaret 2018!

Happy Monday everyone!
