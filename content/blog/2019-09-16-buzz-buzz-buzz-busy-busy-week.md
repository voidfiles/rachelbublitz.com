Hoo-boy do I have a week ahead of me! [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) opens with [Good Company Theatre](https://www.goodcotheatre.com/ripped) on Friday, I'm driving back and forth from Ogden, Utah a total of FOUR times, I have table readings of [*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches) AND a new bonus reading of [*FUNNY, LIKE AN ABORTION*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) (which I need to rewrite by *Wednesday*.... so lots of rewrites too!), emails to write, getting ready for my upcoming trip to UC Davis for the [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) performances, teaching my classes, and on top of all of this I'm expected to also be a human and eat, sleep, and take care of my kiddos. Oy!

Crossing my fingers I can get all this done so that next week I can jump head-first into a mountain of submissions. Because, after all, submission season is upon us!

AND, and, and, after all of that, and submissions, I have another brand new full-length play to write, which I will be spilling the beans on soon.

Okay! Time to get it done.
