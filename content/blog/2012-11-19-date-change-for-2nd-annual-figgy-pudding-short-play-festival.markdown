title: Date Change for 2nd Annual Figgy Pudding Short Play Festival
---

There has been a change to [Unity Stage](http://unitystage.org/unitystage.org/index.html.html)'s upcoming 2nd Annual Figgy Pudding Festival. The new dates are Thursday Dec. 6, Friday Dec. 7, Saturday Dec. 8 at 8pm, Sunday Dec. 9 at 5pm. Tickets are $20, you can [buy them here](http://www.unitystage.org/unitystage.org/Figgy_Pudding_2012.html). All performances are still at [Cafe Marlene](http://www.cafemarlene.com/) in Queens, New York. There are only 40 seats in the house, be sure and buy your tickets in advance!

My short play *Oy Oy Oy, Merry Christmas!* is one of the plays in the festival, and it's one of my favorites. Other playwrights in the festival are: [Jenny Lyn Bader](http://www.jennylynbader.com/), [Mark Cornell](http://www.markcornell.net/mark/Home.html), Chris Graybill, 
[Joni Hilton](http://jonihilton.com/home.php), [Jay Rehak](http://oneactplays.net/rehak.html), Susan A. Salidor, and Stephanie Weber.

I will unfortunately miss the show, so be sure and check it out for me! [Email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) and let me know what you think.
