title: HOW TERRY GROSS DESTROYED MY LIFE, to be produced this January!
---

Back from vacation. It was up and down and all over the place. Glad to be home now. Also glad that I got an email from the folks at [Love Creek Productions](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Love-Creek-Productions/58978756369?fref=ts). They plan on including *How Terry Gross Destroyed My Life* in their January short play series. Will the fun ever stop? I hope not! The show will be in early January, and I'll be announcing dates and the location as soon as I have them.
