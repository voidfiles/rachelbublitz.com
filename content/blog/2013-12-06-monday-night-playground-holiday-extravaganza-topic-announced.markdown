The topic is here! [PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/)'s Holiday Extravaganza topic is.........

####HOLIDAY RECIPE

My husband suggested I make a play pie... Oh that I could, because my pies are delicious. 

Anyway, if you're interested in writing along with the topic too, remember there's a ten page max, and the deadline is Tuesday at 2pm! 

Also, you should get on buying your tickets for the 16th! Here's the link: [http://www.playground-sf.org/boxoffice/](http://www.playground-sf.org/boxoffice/)

That's at Berkeley Rep, December 16th at 8pm. We will find out a week from now which plays have been selected! 

And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a play to write!
