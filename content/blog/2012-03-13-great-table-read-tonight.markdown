title: Great Table Read Tonight
---

Tonight was a table read for Sherezade XII 2012, which my short play "Her Special Day" will be a part of in May. I was blown away by the talent! The other seven plays are well crafted, and the actors were wonderful! I'm excited for the first production of one of my plays!
