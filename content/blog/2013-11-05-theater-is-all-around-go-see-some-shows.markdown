title: Theater Is All Around- Go See Some Shows!
---

November is a great month for you to get out and see some theater, because there are SO many incredible shows happening! So I thought I'd take a minute to alert you to them, so you can go and make that happen!

###[San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/), November 6-23rd

Yes of course I had to promote SF Olympians! There is a mighty army of artists working as I type to make this year great, and all you have to do is show up and enjoy yourself! Each night you'll hear a brand new play, or plays, written by local writers! 36 new plays! 36! That's a lot.

For the full schedule go here: [http://www.sfolympians.com/?p=1791](http://www.sfolympians.com/?p=1791)

The festival runs Wednesday through Saturday, the shows start at 8pm, $10 at the door (CASH ONLY, no advance tickets!), and all of the performances are at the Exit Theater in San Francisco. Don't miss these plays! You'll be sad if you do, especially mine which is THIS SATURDAY, November 9th! 

I recommend arriving early for these shows!

###[Bigger Than A Breadbox](http://www.btabtheatreco.org/)'s [*CRUMBLE (Lay Me Down, Justin Timberlake)*](http://www.btabtheatreco.org/shows/crumble) by Sheila Callaghan, now through November 9th

I have heard a lot of great things about this show! And it's a very short run, so you don't have a lot of chances to get in there and see it! Here are the times and dates for the remaining shows:

November 1 at 8pm

November 2 at 2pm

November 2 at 8pm

November 8 at 8pm

November 9 at 2pm

November 9 at 8pm

This show is also playing at the Exit, and here's a bit more about the show from the event page:

>"Join us at Bigger Than a Breadbox Theatre Co. as we ring in the Christmas season like its the year 2000, with an evening of homicidal scheming and familial blunders.

>A year has passed since the untimely death of Janice's father and everything is falling apart. Janice watches as her mother allows their home to collapse into disrepair and within the walls of the deteriorating apartment, Janice's only comfort is her late-night rendezvous with the always mystical Justin Timberlake. Under the mounting pressure of her mother's panic attacks and the squawking of her cat-obsessed aunt, Janice has to do something drastic to reunite her fractured family. Meanwhile, the apartment is developing murderous plans of its own...

>Come experience an explosive evening with CRUMBLE (LAY ME DOWN, JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE) and take part as the madness unfolds."

###[Performers Under Stress](http://www.pustheatre.com/PUS/PUS_Home_Page.html) presents: [*Scamoramaland*](https://www.facebook.com/events/1411400242411291/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming) by Eve Edelson, running now through November 17th

Neil Higgins, who will be playing Patroclus in my reading, directed *Scamoramaland* by Eve Edelson, and the set up of the play sounds so interesting to me:

>"Performers Under Stress (PUS) continues their Seventh Season in San Francisco with the play that asks the question: Can an ambitious young scammer find happiness and a literary career on the Internet? This new play by Bay Area playwright and filmmaker Eve Edelson explores a topic with which anyone in the Internet industry or with email will be familiar: Nigerian email scams!

>Freddy, a young Internet scammer with dreams of an artistic career, is striking out in the world of email fraud. Most of his potential victims turn out to be pranksters. Under pressure from his thuggish boss to score, Freddy takes increasing risks and must finally decide what kind of man he will be. Meanwhile, as they concoct ever more humiliating surprises for Freddy, his tormenters begin to feel a bond with each other -- but if they met in the flesh, could they stand each other? or can they only be friends in Scamoramaland?"

*Scamoramaland* is playing at the Bindlestiff Studio, and you can get your tickets here: [http://scamoramaland-efbevent.eventbrite.com/](http://scamoramaland-efbevent.eventbrite.com/)

Do it! Time is running out on this show too!

###[Impact Theatre](http://www.impacttheatre.com/season/index.php)'s [*Troilus and Cressida*](http://www.impacttheatre.com/season/) by William Shakespeare, directed by [Melissa Hillman](http://bittergertrude.com/about/), November 7 - December 15

I am super excited for this show because it will be the first time I see Impact Theatre's take on Shakespeare, AND because it's about the Trojan War! You can bone up on your greek myth at the SF Olympians Festival, and then feel super smart when you watch this show later in the month. That's my plan anyway.

>"It is the seventh year of the Trojan War. Everyone is battle-weary, and no one is really sure that the war is still worth pursuing. In the Greek camp, troop morale is at an all-time low as King Agamemnon can’t persuade Achilles to get off his ass and fight. In Troy, royal family members debate whether they should just give Helen back to the Greeks and be done with the whole thing. And yet, love still flowers: Trojan Prince Troilus pines for Cressida, who plays hard to get until she can no longer deny her desire for him. But just as they finally come together, a political trade rips them apart. In a world where everyone speaks of honor but few actually embody it, the play exposes the callous ways in which the petty whims of the privileged few endanger the lives of the millions beneath them.

>Featuring Jonathon Brooks, Andrew Chung, Miyaka Cochrane, Sarah Coykendall, Carl Holvick-Thomas, Michael Uy Kelly, Eric Kerr, Julie Kuwabara, Roy Landaverde, Jonah McClellan, Sean Mirkovich, Jon Nagel, Akemi Okamura, Lauren Spencer, Nick Trengove, and ShawnJ West"

###[Custom Made Theatre Co.](http://www.custommade.org/)'s [*Peter/Wendy*](http://www.custommade.org/peterwendy/) adapted and directed by Jeremy Bloom, November 19 - December 15

Peter Pan! I've been excited for this show since August when I found out that local actor, Sam Bertken would be playing Peter Pan. Here's a bit more about the show from Custom Made's website:

>"In recreating J.M. Barie’s Peter and Wendy for our times, Bloom transforms the uniquely hallowed cathedral space of The Gough Street Playhouse into the world of Never-Never Land, as his seven pajama-clad performers fly, dance, and move around the space in perfect sync.

>Bloom explains his Peter/Wendy, saying “it’s not some new crazy adaptation, but the story stripped down to its bare elements.  The book was intended to be read aloud to children, but it was also written and continuously rewritten by a person in a state of perpetual loss. All of the characters are fiercely grown up enough to have ideas about death and to be exhilarated by good storytelling.”"
