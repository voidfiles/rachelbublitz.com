title: Writing For Quantum Dragon Theatre's The Forge
---

And the news just keeps on coming, I'm delighted to announce that one of the six plays I'm writing this year will be for [Quantum Dragon Theatre](http://www.quantumdragon.org/)'s [The Forge](http://www.quantumdragon.org/copy-of-the-forge-2016)! The Forge is all about new play development, and will be giving this new play a developmental reading, offer dramaturgical support, and host a staged reading sometime this coming Fall. I love having early homes for plays AND having more reasons for visiting San Francisco. This satisfies both, it's perfect! 

The play I'll be developing is tentatively called "*Happily*" and will have a similar style to "*Of Serpents & Sea Spray*", mixing and mashing reality and fantasy life. "*Happily*" will focus on a single mom trying to support herself and her child while still finding time for creativity and maybe even true love.

And "*Happily*" isn't the only play for this year's Forge, I'm thrilled to be joined in this program with new plays by [Claire Ann Rice](http://claireannrice.blogspot.com/), Christina Bauer, and [Jennifer Lynne Roberts](http://www.jenniferlynneroberts.typepad.com/).

More info on the plays, the dates for the readings, and all sorts of other good stuff will come soon, so stay tuned!
