I'm working on something brand new and exciting (details and title will come soon, I promise) and I'd love to hear from all of you out there who spent any time at a sleep away camp! It's a quick ten questions about the summers you spent away from home around a campfire. I think? I don't know! That's why I'm asking!...

Any and all answers are super helpful. And if you know of anyone who went to a camp, please please please send them this way!
