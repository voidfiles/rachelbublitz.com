I've been writing and submitting away all month so far (16 submission by the 16th day, woo!), but I'm leaving soon for vacation and I was oh-so hoping to have enough submissions under my belt to not worry the rest of the month.

SO, theater people, if you have any hot leads on submissions, send 'em this way. Or if you as a theater professional want to read some of my work, that is also wonderful. Email me at [Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) and help me hit my numbers. I need 14 more opportunities to finish June off right. THANKS!
