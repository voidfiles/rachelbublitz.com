title: Writing, Rewriting... All The Writing

Busy, busy week ahead for me. Rehearsal tonight for *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* (reading coing up Monday 3/3, details here: [https://www.facebook.com/events/265759466916913/?notif_t=plan_user_joined](https://www.facebook.com/events/265759466916913/?notif_t=plan_user_joined)), rewrote the last two scenes to *The Red House Monster* (spoiler alert: crazy things happen!), set up a meeting with a possible director for *The Red House Monster* reading in November (fingers crossed!), wrote a new scene for my not-yet-titled Pegasus play, and picked up a book of interviews put together by [StoryCorps](http://storycorps.org/), if you haven't heard of them check it out, that I plan on using for my "adapting from non-fiction exercise" due next week. Exciting, fun, and busy! So, so busy.

Check back tomorrow, I'll be announcing the cast for the March 3rd *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* reading, and you don't want to miss that.
