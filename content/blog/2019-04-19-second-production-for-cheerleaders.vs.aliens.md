I have some great news to share: [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119869/cheerleaders-vs-aliens) will have its second production this summer with Chicago Park District's summer theater program! In case you're in the Chicago area and love super fun plays, it's running July 29th - August 1st at Berger Park Coach House Theater. They'll be performing a one-hour version of the play that I modified specifically for them.

Stay tuned for photos from this production, and other awesome updates.

Happy Friday!
