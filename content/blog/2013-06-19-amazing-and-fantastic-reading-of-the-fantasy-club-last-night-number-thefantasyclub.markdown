Last night my terrific cast ([Siobhan Doherty](http://www.siobhanmariedoherty.com/), Tavis Kammet, [Claire Rice](http://claireannrice.blogspot.com/), [Rob Dario](https://sites.google.com/site/thenewrobdariotimes/)) read the updated script of *The Fantasy Club*! What a blast. The new draft is *so* good guys, I am extremely proud of my script, and I am *so* happy with my cast and crew. This show is going to be fantastic! 

SO! If you haven't donated yet, do! You'll get to be a part of this great show, and it'll make you feel oh so good. Here's the link: [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz).

On that subject, huge thank you to the fabulous [Marissa Skudlarek](http://marissabidilla.blogspot.com/) for her donation! We couldn't do it without you... 

No, we seriously cannot do it without you guys... Only $1,723 to go! And as we raise more money, we will release *more* funny... That's right, more videos and pictures to make you crack up all over the place. So throw us a bone... And tell your friends to do the same! #thefantasyclub!

Thanks!
