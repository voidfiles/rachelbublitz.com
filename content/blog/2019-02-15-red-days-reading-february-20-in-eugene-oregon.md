Hip hip hooray, I have the date and time for the very first public reading of [*RED DAYS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/232234/red-days)! *RED DAYS* is getting a workshop through KCACTF Region 7's Design through Dramaturgy program *and* a staged reading during the conference next week in Eugene, Oregon. In the area? Here are the details:

Reading of *RED DAYS* by Rachel Bublitz  
Directed by Stephen John  
Wednesday, February 20th 8pm  
At the [Oregon Contemporary Theatre](https://www.octheatre.org/)  

Here's a synopsis for the play:

>"As the air quality in Salt Lake climbs to crisis levels, we follow Dianna through four seasons, trying to balance school, her running team, and pursuing her passion. But as she nears the end of her senior year, she's forced to decide if her running dream truly belongs to her, or if it's more her mother's, while around her the serious effects of the air quality wreak havoc on those athletes who dare breath hard in the open air."

I would love to see your smiling faces at the reading, and to hear your feedback! *RED DAYS* is in those painful and early stages of development so any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

If you are able to make it out, please [email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) so I can put you on the list! Otherwise it's conference attendees only.

Will I see you next week in Oregon? Sure hope so! Happy Friday!
