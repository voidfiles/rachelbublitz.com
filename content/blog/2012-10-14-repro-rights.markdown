title: Repro Rights! 10/22
---

Have you purchased your tickets for Repro Rights! yet? I hope you get on it. Not only does it feature eight local writers (including me!), but it's also for a wonderful cause; all of the money raised for this event goes to Planned Parenthood. 

Go [here](https://www.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?e=405c60cb11c033b51ae7b8251f643dab&t=tix) to buy your tickets. The show is at 7:30 on October 22nd, and there are three ticket prices; $100 premiere, $25 general, and $10 student/senior.

Here is the full line up:

My Body, by Rachel Bublitz

Prisoner of Love, by Dana Sack

Lunch at the Cafe Ova, by Margy Kahn

Snip Snip, by [Ignacio Zulueta](http://www.ignaciozulueta.com/)

A Cry in Ramah, by [Jeremy Cole](http://www.jeremycole.org/index.html)

Factory Farm: A Documentary, by [Jennifer Lynne Roberts](http://www.jenniferlynneroberts.typepad.com/)

It's Good to Know, by [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/)

I hope to see you there! Let me know what you think of my play!
