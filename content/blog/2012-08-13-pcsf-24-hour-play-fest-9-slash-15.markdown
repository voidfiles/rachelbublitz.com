title: PCSF 24 Hour Play Fest. 9/15
---

I was selected to participate in [Playwright's Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/)'s 24 Play Festival! I should say that I did nothing to be selected, it was selection at random.... Doesn't change the fact that I'm totally amped up for this! 

Basically, on September 14th, I'll be given a topic, and actors ay 8pm. I will have until 9am (I think) on the 15th to get the script to the director and actors. They will take it and put it up! There will be two shows on Saturday the 15th. One at 7:30pm and one at 10pm. It's gonna be good. Ticket info will be posted when I have it, stay tuned!
