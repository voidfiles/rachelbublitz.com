Dreams do come true... I get to work with my number one choice of director for the world premiere of *THE NIGHT WITCHES* at the [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre)!! Alexandra Harbold, local Salt Lake director, actor, dramaturg, professor, and Co-Artistic Director of [Flying Bobcat](http://flyingbobcat.org/) said yes to directing! 

I've been wanting to work with Alexandra for years, I find her use of space, the detail in the movement created in all the plays she directs, and her overall theater-sense wonderful and so engaging. I am ecstatic to finally have the opportunity to put our talents together. Last week we made it official over tea with the Egyptian Youtheatre's Artistic Director Jamie Wilcox. I can't wait to start digging in to this play with both of these fierce and inspiring women, especially since the play is all about fierce and inspiring women! 

Dream big, that's the message here.

Happy Tuesday, everyone!
