title: Merry Christmas!
---

This will (probably) be my last post until the 2013, so I wanted to wish everyone a Merry Christmas... (See what a bad Jew I am? I totally forgot to tell everyone Happy Hanukkah).

Anyway, happy holidays! I hope that you find yourself with people that you love. And just in case you feel compelled to buy me something (as I'm sure you do), here's my list:

1. Time to write between now and New Year's.
2. More sleep.
3. Safe and happy children.

There that's it! Now, you had better rush out to the store, they'll be closing soon. And they always sell out of the good stuff. If you're wondering, #3 is the priority.

Merry Christmas!
