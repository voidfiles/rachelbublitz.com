I'm counting down the days, and there are only THREE left between now and when I leave for [Outvisible Theatre Company](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/)'s [Detroit New Works Festival](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/playwriting-opportunities/newworks/)! [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) is the first in the five play festival line-up this weekend, and my reading is at 2:30 on Saturday. 

*RIPPED* will be directed by Mycah Leigh Artis and features Anna Doyle, Scott Anthony Joy, and Michael Lopetrone. And after there'll be a talkback with me and the cast!

SO! Are you in/near Detroit? Do you love to travel the world in order to watch my plays? If you had a yes for either or both of those questions I hope to see you Saturday!
