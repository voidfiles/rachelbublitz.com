Opening night for [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) is only TWO flipping days away. Can you believe? We are in previews tonight and tomorrow, and last I heard opening night is thisclose to completely selling out! If I were you I would be racing over to [www.zspace.org/rippedshow](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow) and getting my tickets pronto.

I was also interviewed by [Lily Janiak](https://twitter.com/LilyJaniak) with the SF Chronicle, [check that out here](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/theater/the-radical-openness-of-playwright-rachel-bublitz), or pick yourself up today's paper! I *love* the title of the article Lily wrote, "The radical openness of playwright Rachel Bublitz." This whole thing continues to be a crazy and wonderful dream!

And and and I also had the chance to chat with playwright [Kenneth Jones](https://www.bykennethjones.com/), and you can read that [interview from his blog here](https://www.bykennethjones.com/in-her-new-play-ripped-rachel-bublitz-explores-the-murky-reality-of-a-campus-rape/)!

And I did more interviews! There will be more articles on their way soon....

In the meantime, [get your tickets](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow)! If you see it this week be sure to say hello to me! I'll be the playwright hiding in the corner.

Happy almost opening!
