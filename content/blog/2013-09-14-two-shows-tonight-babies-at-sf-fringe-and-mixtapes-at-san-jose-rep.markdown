title: 'Two Shows Tonight: BABIES at SF Fringe and Mixtapes at San Jose Rep'
---

Tonight you have TWO options to see my plays! In San Francisco tonight at 9pm you can see the hilarious [BABIES, The Ultimate Birth Control](https://www.facebook.com/events/158170084370589/) at [the Exit](http://www.theexit.org/), and in San Jose, you can see [Mixtapes Volume One](https://www.facebook.com/events/197566687084682/) starting around 10:30 (get there by 10:15 to make sure you get a seat!) at [San Jose Rep](http://www.sjrep.com/). It's hard choices, I know, picking between these two shows, but rest assured, you'll have more chances to see both shows! There are two more performances for both shows! So if you pick one over the other tonight, you don't have to fret.

For BABIES, we have the show tonight at 9pm, and also a show tomorrow (9/15) at 1pm, and Tuesday (9/17) at 9pm. Buy your tickets here: [http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/390070](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/390070)

And for Mixtapes Volume One, the show is also playing next Friday and Saturday night (starting at 10:30). For this show, you pay-what-you-can at the door.

Hope you can make it out!
