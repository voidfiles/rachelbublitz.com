title: READING BABAR IN 2070 in Best of PlayGround 19
---

Thrilled to announce that my short play *READING BABAR IN 2070* is in this year's [Best of PlayGround 19](http://blog.playground-sf.org/2015/04/playgrounds-19th-playground-festival-of.html) festival running May 7th-24th at [Thick House](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1695+18th+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94107/@37.7620355,-122.399214,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808f7fcb04f2561f:0x8a3295b31183fcb2)! I wrote *READING BABAR IN 2070* last October for [PlayGround](http://playground-sf.org/index.php)'s first collaboration with [Sustainable World Coalition](http://swcoalition.org/)! It was presented at [Berkeley Rep](http://www.berkeleyrep.org/) as well as Stanford for the Planet Earth New Play Festival.

I can also tell you that Rebecca Ennals will be my director! I got to work with her just last weekend for [SWANDay](http://bestevents.us/berkeley-swan-day-bay-area-2015-celebrating-women-in-theatre/308081) in Berkeley, and I'm thrilled to get to work together again. AND, Rebecca will be directing [Tracy Held Potter's play for Loud & Unladylike](http://loudandunladylike.com/post/104263390984/meet-tracy-held-potter) this summer!
