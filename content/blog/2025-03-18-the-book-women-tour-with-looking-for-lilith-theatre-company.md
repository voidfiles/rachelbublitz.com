[Looking for Lilith Theatre Company](https://lookingforlilith.org/) is touring [*The Book Women*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/the-book-women) this summer in Louisville, Kentucky at local libraries. I'm not sure I can express how happy this makes me! The history of these women who delivered books on horseback still inspires me, will most likely always inspire me, and I'm honored that my play can help spread the word about them. Here's more about the *The Book Women*:

>*"But I come to learn... It's not just food that feeds us. Sharin’ feeds us. Singin’ feeds us.
Readin’ books feeds us." -Erma, THE BOOK WOMEN*

>*Saddle up and journey into the hills of Eastern Kentucky with THE BOOK WOMEN, an inspiring play by Rachel Bublitz, about the courageous Pack Horse Librarians of the 1930s. With a dedication equal to the US Postal Service, these remarkable young women braved rugged terrain on horseback to bring books—and hope—to remote Appalachian communities. They bring the promise that, if we support one another, tomorrow will be better.*

*The Book Women* will tour from June to August, for dates, libraries, and more information, please click here: [*The Book Women* tour with Looking for Lilith Theatre Company](http://localhost:1313/2025/03/18/the-book-women-tour-with-looking-for-lilith-theatre-company/).
