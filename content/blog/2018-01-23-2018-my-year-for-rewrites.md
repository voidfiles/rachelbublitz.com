+++

Last year was the year of first drafts, I wrote [FIVE first drafts](https://rachelbublitz.com/2017/12/19/fantastic-failure/) of full-length plays, and while I could feel my writer muscles grow because of it, this will be my year for rewriting. I'm planning to tackle a lot of my material from last year, and also some older work that I'm hoping to blow dust off from and get people excited about. I've got a lot of plays on my wish-list to strengthen, as usual I'm thinking big:

* *HAPPILY* - full length
* *NO MAP* - full length
* *BURST* - full length
* *MOMMY DANCES WITH THE DEVIL* - full length
* *ONCE A SPY* - full length, new and exciting development info about this play is coming down the pipeline! 
* *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS* - full length (and actually I've already turned in the production ready draft of this, though I'm prepared for small changes once rehearsals get going)
* *LET'S FIX ANDY* - full length, hopefully in a workshop production which I'm waiting to find out about so keep your fingers crossed for me on this one!

That's so much! And some of these need major overhauls, so I'll be keeping busy for sure.

But that's not all! I couldn't go a whole year not writing anything brand new, I have my full-length Christmas play I started last year that I'm planning on pushing a first draft out for, as well as a play inspired by Shakespeare for the [Shakespeare New Contemporaries Project](http://www.sncproject.com/), I also want to write a love story this year as well. So that's three new full-lengths, seven redrafts of older full-lengths, AND a first draft of my 30-minute one-act for the Plan-B school tour! Oh and let's not forget that submission mission. 

Generating all of this new and slightly new work, I'm realizing I need to expand my theater horizons here in Salt Lake. So, if you're an actor, director, or playwright and you'd like to be on my list of folks I reach out to when I need new things read, shoot me an email: [Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com). I love meeting new theater artists and I'm gonna need a boatload of people I can reach out to while I'm planning all the informal table reads I'll be putting together over the next bunch of months. 

Okay, time to get to work!
