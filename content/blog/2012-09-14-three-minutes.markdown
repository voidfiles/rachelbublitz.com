###Three Minutes

A three minute play by Rachel Bublitz

Characters:

June, female, 45-65 years old

Felix, 20 years old

*JUNE and FELIX are on stage. FELIX has an IV in his arm, and is strapped to a hospital bed.*

JUNE
There are only three minutes left until-

FELIX
(Interrupting) I know! Stop nagging me.

JUNE
Three minutes isn’t very long-

FELIX
(Interrupting) I graduated from kindergarten, I know how long three minutes is.

JUNE
I wasn’t trying to belittle you.

FELIX
Whatever.

*Pause.*

JUNE
We could call her. With your last-

FELIX
(Interrupting) I’m her only son, I’m dying. And she doesn’t show? No fucking way we’re calling her.

JUNE
She can’t walk.

FELIX
They told me.

JUNE
She lost her foot.

FELIX
I know! Shit, don’t you listen?

JUNE
I’m just trying to impress upon you how challenging coming here would be for her. 

FELIX
But she’s my mom! She should be here.

*Pause.*

JUNE
Would you like to pray with me?

FELIX
Pray? How come I got a woman here? Aren’t there rules against that?

JUNE
You told the warden you’d prefer a woman.

FELIX
I wasn’t serious.

JUNE
It’s too late. (Pause) Do you believe in God?

FELIX
No.

*Pause.*

JUNE
Would you like to get anything off your chest Felix? These are your last moments.

FELIX
Someone might call though, right? They can stop it? I’ve seen that on TV.

JUNE
No one is going to call.

FELIX
How do you know that? Huh? It could happen.

JUNE
You admitted to killing sixteen people-

FELIX
(Interrupting) Yeah, but-

JUNE
(Interrupting) Five of which were children.

FELIX
But I was only fourteen. I was a kid.

JUNE
Are you sorry for what you did Felix?

*Pause.*

FELIX
I don’t want to die. Please.

FELIX
Will it hurt?

JUNE
No, it will be like falling asleep.

FELIX
I have a hard time falling asleep.

JUNE
It will be quick. (Speaking to someone off stage.) We’re ready.

FELIX
I’m not ready! That wasn’t three minutes! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, okay? I want my mom! Where’s my mommy? Please, stop. Please. I don’t want to die!

*FELIX falls asleep, and then dies.*

JUNE
May God have mercy on your soul.

*End of play.*
