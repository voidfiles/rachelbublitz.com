title: Pacifica Table Readers Sunday 2/3
---

Want to hear the new play I'm writing for next year's Olympians? Well you can hear a first draft of it in February! The [Pacifica Table Readers](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Pacifica_table_readers/) have invited me to bring it for a living room read! The date is Sunday, February 3rd! 

More details will be announced in a couple of weeks, but for now... Mark those calendars!
