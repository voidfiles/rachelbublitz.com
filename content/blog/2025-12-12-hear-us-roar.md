Last month we opened and closed the developmental production of [*Hear Us Roar*](https://newplayexchange.org/script/3193750/hear-us-roar) at the University of Utah. *Hear Us Roar* was directed by one of my all-time favorite collaborators, Alexandra Harbold, who put together an amazing team! I learned so much! In fact, I learned so much that I was making script changes in between our four performances, throwing new lines and cuts at my actors along with many thanks from me, as I knew I was asking them to do a very hard thing! And boy did they rise to it! Thank you Alexandra and the whole cast!

Call Vande Veegaete was our movement director, he worked with my daughter (!) and some of her teammates to better understand the movement needed to create the idea of water polo on stage. Thank you Call! I was so floored by your creativity!

Not only was I blessed with fearless actors and directors, but additionally our rehearsal process and two of our four performances were documented by photographer Ashlee Macdonald. She caught some amazing moments that I'm only sharing a few of here, for more head on over to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/playwrightbublitz/). Thank you Ashlee! Your photos are amazing and it was lovely to have you in the room with us during the process.

With this developmental production I wanted to explore how water polo could be done on a stage. It was thrilling to work with so many theater artists game to explore how that could happen. I hope that soon I'll be explore this even further, like in a world premiere, but until then I have a big rewrite to finish. Stay tuned for when I post a new draft of *Hear Us Roar* on the New Play Exchange!
