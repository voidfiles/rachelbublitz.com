They're finally here! Production photos from the world premiere of [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119869/cheerleaders-vs-aliens) at the [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre)!

I was just going to pick a few to share, but there are a millions I have to put out in the world - they are just TOO GOOD! Here's a taste of my favorites:

The amazing sets are the work of Matt Sincell, and the beautiful costumes were done by Candy Summerhays (who also did props!) and Megan Crivello!

A HUGE and GIANT thank you to Jenn Silva for capturing all of these great shots! And there are more! So much more! To get the whole enchilada, you'll need to head over to [my official facebook page where I have an album dedicated to this production](https://www.facebook.com/pg/rachelnbublitz/photos/?tab=album&album_id=537054869752197) (is super easy, just click that link!).

Happy Thursday!
