title: Hedda Gabler
---

Just finished Ibsen's Hedda Gabler. Blew... My... Mind. Why had I never read this play before? Why? Why did no one bring this to me when I loved to act (and had time to act)? Hedda Gabler has to be one of the best roles I have ever read. I am completely in love with her complicated, terrible, yet somehow endearing ways. If you have not read this play run out (yes now) and buy it. I'll wait here....

Got it? Excellent. Read it.

How does Ibsen make Hedda so horrid and completely irresistible all at once? He's a genius. That's the only explanation I can think of. Attention theatres near me... Someone please produce Hedda Gabler so I can see it staged. Thank you, that is all.
