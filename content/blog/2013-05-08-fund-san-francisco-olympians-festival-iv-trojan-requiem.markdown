title: 'Fund San Francisco Olympians Festival IV: Trojan Requiem!'
---

[San Francisco Olympians Festival](https://www.facebook.com/pages/San-Francisco-Olympians-Festival/282661841972?ref=stream&hc_location=stream) has kicked off it's fundraising campaign! We need your support to keep this fabulous commissioned theatre and fine arts festival alive and running. Check out the [indiegogo campaign here](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/san-francisco-olympians-festival-iv-trojan-requiem?show_todos=true)!

There aren't a lot of festivals out there that commission work, and that's only one of the reasons why the San Francisco Olympians Festival is so special. As a writer you come across so many opportunities that have a topic or theme but ask for finished pieces, and typically don't give you enough time to complete something new for it. You're left with either lucking out and happen to already have something that fits, or changing something that you've already written to fit their guidelines. With this festival you write a proposal and then have a year to finish your piece. And at the end of the whole process you have a reading of this new work. San Francisco Olympians Festival brings artist together to create and gives them a home to do that in. It's a rare thing, and should be supported! And that's just the tip of the iceberg, to learn all about the festival and all of the opportunities it creates watch the [video](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/san-francisco-olympians-festival-iv-trojan-requiem?show_todos=true) on indiegogo!
