title: Day 4, Play 7
---

I just submitted my seventh play today. It would be another installment of the full length I'm now working on "Things We Can't Say Out Loud." I've actually had this play in the back of my mind for a long time and just banged it out today because I had to write something! That's the beauty of the [31 Plays in 31 Days Project](http://31plays31days.com) you just have to do it. I have 24 more plays left to write. Wish me luck!
