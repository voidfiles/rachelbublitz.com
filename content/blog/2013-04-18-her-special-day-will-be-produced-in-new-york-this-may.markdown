title: HER SPECIAL DAY Will Be Produced In New York This May!
---

Exciting news! *Her Special Day*, the first that got a production will be produced again in New York City! *Her Special Day* was produced by [Wily West](http://www.wilywestproductions.com/) for Sheherezade XII in May of 2012, and now it'll be staged by [Love Creek Production](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Love-Creek-Productions/58978756369?fref=ts) for their short play showcase next month in May.

This also means that I now have productions or readings of my work in every month for a year! Woo! It began last September, with 24-Hour Playfest as well as [Play Cafe](http://www.playcafe.org/)'s reading of the opening of *Terrible *People*, and now with May covered I'll go a full year! Just goes to show that it pays to submit like a mad woman.

The show will be late in May, and dates/times/places will be announced soon!
