Theater news! It's been a long time, for me at least, to have so much theater news! BUT, this coming Monday, May 17th, I have a staged reading of my two-hander comedy [*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) in [PlayGround's Zoom Fest](https://playground-sf.org/zoomfest/)! We just had our first rehearsal yesterday and everything is firing on all cylinders, my amazing actors, the incredible director, and yes, even my script! Here's more:

>Monroe finds herself knocked up, and since abortions are illegal in the United States, she throws a surprise abortion party with her best friend Jade. Monroe prepares over twenty at home abortion options for them to sort through, neither will walk away until they select the best of all of these terrible options. But that's not all! Come on down for juggling, a tap dancing number, and a horrific view at what our future may hold. A comedic two-hander in one scene.

### The reading of *Funny, Like An Abortion* will take place Monday, May 17th at 7pm PST over Zoom!

Directed by Giovanna Sardelli  

Elissa Beth Stebbins (Monroe) and Rebecca Pingree (Jade) make up my cast, with Stacey Winn reading stage directions.

I hope you will tune in Monday night! [Click here for tickets and more info](https://playground-sf.org/festivalreadings/).

(And make sure to remember the time! It's 7pm Pacific Standard Time! Don't get bit in the but like me and mess up your time zones!)

See you then!
