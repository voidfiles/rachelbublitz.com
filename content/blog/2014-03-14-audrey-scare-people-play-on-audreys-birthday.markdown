title: AUDREY SCARE PEOPLE PLAY On Audrey's Birthday!
---

Today is Audrey's sixth birthday! I could think of nothing better than sharing the first play she ever wrote! She wrote this play last year, right before her fifth birthday. Last year with [San Francisco Theater Pub](http://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/)'s PUB FROM ANOTHER WORLD, *Audrey Scare People Play* came to life! You can watch the video of that here: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L28OHv7_Ec&hd=1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L28OHv7_Ec&hd=1).

Her video is right after the intro, it starts at the 4:10 mark. 

Enjoy!

I AM GOING TO GO STEAL SOME BUTTER FROM YOU!

AUDREY

Put that butter back right now!

SCARE PEOPLE

I will not, no.

AUDREY

Scare People, don’t think about doing anything else! Don’t think about it!

SCARE PEOPLE

I AM GOING TO GO INTO THE REFRIGERATOR, BECAUSE THE SUN IS RISING!

*SCARE PEOPLE goes into the refrigerated, and closes the door. AUDREY opens the refrigerator door, SCARE PEOPLE opens it, this happens several more times.*

AUDREY

Go outside! You’re in big trouble, and we’re gonna put you outside and we’re never gonna open the door.

*AUDREY shakes with fear. AUDREY gets a pen from a drawer. SCARE PEOPLE opens the door to the refrigerator and sneaks out. AUDREY stabs SCARE PEOPLE with a pen. SCARE PEOPLE puts a band aid on the cut.*

SCARE PEOPLE

You lose, I’m gonna stay at your house!

*AUDREY stabs SCARE PEOPLE with the pen again. SCARE PEOPLE puts on another band aid.*

AUDREY

GET OUT OF MY HOUSE OR I’LL STAB YOU IN THE FACE!

*SCARE PEOPLE tries to scratch AUDREY with his claws, but is not successful. AUDREY stabs him again with the pen. SCARE PEOPLE flies up to the ceiling. AUDREY gets a broom out and sweeps SCARE PEOPLE into the trash. SCARE PEOPLE gets out of the trash.*

SCARE PEOPLE

YOU’LL HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT!

*AUDREY throws shoes at SCARE PEOPLE.*

AUDREY

I’LL TRICK YOU, SCARE PEOPLE!

*AUDREY gets a stick of butter out of the refrigerator, opens the door and throws the butter out. SCARE PEOPLE doesn’t go out to get the butter. SCARE PEOPLE gets back into the refrigerator and closes the door.*

AUDREY (CONTINUED)

Then I won’t go into the refrigerator. I’m going to sleep.

*AUDREY exits to go to sleep. End of play.*
