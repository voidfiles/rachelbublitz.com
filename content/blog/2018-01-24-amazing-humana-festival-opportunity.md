Would you like a free package to attend one of the [Humana Festival](https://actorstheatre.org/humana-festival-of-new-american-plays/)'s weekends this year? Well, it's your lucky day because you can now apply for a [Humana Festival Emerging Leaders Grant](https://actorstheatre.org/humana-festival/emerging-leaders-grant/) which would allow you to see a weekend of the 42nd Humana Festival and give you 50% off additional weekends in case you wanted to stay. The deadline for the application is coming up quick on February 9th. You'll need to book your own airfare as well as hotel, but the tickets to all the events including panel discussions and world premiere productions will be free for you!

To see if you're eligible, jump on over to the [Actor's Theatre of Louisville website](https://actorstheatre.org/2018/01/22/emerging-leaders-grant-applications-now-available/) and read the rules and guidelines for the grant. As far as applications go, it's very straight forward requiring only that you answer two questions, upload your resume, and provide one reference. SO! What are you waiting for? The 42nd Humana Festival is waiting!
