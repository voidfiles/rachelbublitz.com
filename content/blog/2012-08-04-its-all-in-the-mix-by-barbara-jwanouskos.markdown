title: It's All In The Mix by Barbara Jwanouskos
---

So excited for tonight! Tonight I'm seeing a new play by [Barbara Jwanouskos](http://dynamicsofgroove.wordpress.com/) called ["It's All In The Mix"](https://www.facebook.com/events/434243053263196/) (click title for FB event). My husband and I are celebrating our SEVEN year anniversary tonight, and since he was as excited as I was about this play (a bit of a Christmas miracle really) it made perfect sense for evening tonight (plus we're cheap skates who can afford only so much babysitting). The play is a part of [All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/)'s 2012 season. Click [here](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/257660) for tickets. In addition to tonight performance at 8pm, there's also shows next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night also at 8pm. The show is at the record store called [VAMP](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=547+Athol+Ave,+Oakland,+California+94606&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x808f873faf40fdc1:0x5248d1137c4c8dd0,547+Athol+Ave,+Oakland,+CA+94606&gl=us&ei=FJ4dUODIMsikiQLwiYCQAg&ved=0CAkQ8gEwAA) in Oakland.
