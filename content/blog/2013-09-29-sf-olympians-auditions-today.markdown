title: SF Olympians Auditions Today
---

Callooh! Callay! The [San Francisco Olympians](http://www.sfolympians.com/) [auditions](https://www.facebook.com/events/284030435071646/) are today! Oh, I can't wait. They kick off at 2, and I just can't wait to see and hear all the fantastic actors that come in to vie for a spot in all the readings coming up this November. I've heard from actors, playwrights, and directors, that these auditions are unlike most auditions; they're fun, fast paced, and since there will be nearly (or maybe more?) than 40 people in the room, the actors actually get a good sized audience to work in front of, which always helps. I'll be at the exit from 2pm until 9pm tonight, in it for the long hall... 

If you're sad because you don't have a spot, don't fret! Come on down today between 6:30 and 8 PM, there is some open spaces at the time.

And if you aren't an actor but want to be involved now is the time! Submissions are being accepted for next year's festival until this Monday (TOMORROW!) at midnight. Go here for a list of the topics: [http://www.sfolympians.com/?p=1600](http://www.sfolympians.com/?p=1600).
