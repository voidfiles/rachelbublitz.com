Holy cow! Best flipping flapping news *EVER*!

[*Funny, Like An Abortion*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/450187/funny-abortion) is getting a [National New Play Network](https://nnpn.org/) [Rolling World Premiere](https://nnpn.org/rolling-world-premiere)!!!!

(Insert joyful screams and celebratory dancing here!)

Receiving an NNPN Rolling World Premiere for one of my plays has been a major goal of mine for years. I am *thrilled* to finally reached this goal, and even more so for it to be happening with *this* play, in *this* country, at *this* moment.

Stay tuned for so many more details!!!

*Funny, Like An Abortion*, (maybe) coming to a theater near you!
