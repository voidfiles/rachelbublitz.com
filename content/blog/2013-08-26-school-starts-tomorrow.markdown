title: School starts tomorrow!
---

Tomorrow is the FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL! I have my craft of translation class in the early afternoon. I am very excited about being back in school, and also nervous about if the chid care that I've set up for my kids will work. Time will only tell...

Also exciting, Audrey starts kindergarten on Wednesday! This September, my schedule is loaded with awesome theater, back-to-school fun for Audrey, and my graduate classes. Right now parking and child care are the things keeping me up at night... Oh, also the fact that if I stay on track and finish my degree on time, Jonah (my son) will be finishing his first year of kindergarten when I finish up my degree. I hope I make it. 

In other fun news, I've been working hard perfecting my proposals for next year's [SF Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/). The theme this year is Monsters, and if you haven't already, you should start researching what *you'll* be proposing to write. There are some really fun topics, and I couldn't speak more highly about being involved with this festival. You meet some very exciting artists all working to put together a very special theater event. So check out the topics (listed on their website, [sfolympians.com](http://www.sfolympians.com/)) and get your stuff together. You have until September 30th.

That's all for now! I'll report back tomorrow on how my first class goes!
