title: From One Challenge To The Next
---

It is August 31st, and I'm more than a little emotional. I've gotten a lot of emails for playwrights just saying thank you. Thank you for the challenge, the encouragement, the community, and it feels amazing. We've generated over 4,000 new plays this month and it's not yet midnight. Some folks have some catching up to do, we might just hit 5,000. I talked about my month on the 31 Plays in 31 Days website, if you'd like to read more about mine and Tracy Held Potter's experience, read it [here](http://31plays31days.com/blog/2012/08/31/our-experience/).

Tomorrow will be September 1st, the beginning of [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/playwrightbinge/). Each day for the month of September you submit a play... Good thing I have 31 *new* plays now! And thankfully, I'm only a participant... I'm not running that show.

We also have some exciting news coming up... Big things are happening at [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/). We'll be announcing them shortly so stay tuned!
