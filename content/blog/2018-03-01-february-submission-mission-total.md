Oh hey, it's the first day of March, the *perfect* time to look back at February and see how I'm doing with my insane submission mission for the year.... This February was so much better than last year's, [my 2017 submission total for February](https://rachelbublitz.com/2017/03/01/february-submissions/) was a measly 13! Which isn't unusual, as submission opportunities are often hard to come by in February, they tend to pick up a bunch in March. But as I'm taking no prisoners this year I didn't leave a stone unturned in order to find every single theater/festival/residency/publisher looking for plays - AND IT PAID OFF! This month I submitted as much as I submitted last month, which is a total of FORTY EIGHT scripts! I'm on track to slay my submission mission for the year, and I'm *only* four plays away from having sent out 100 scripts for the year! In only two months! 

[Last March I sent out 64 scripts](https://rachelbublitz.com/2017/03/31/march-submissions/), the most I've ever gotten out in a month. Here's to hoping I smash that and make it to over 150 submissions before April.

I want to give a shout-out to some of the blogs, facebook pages, websites, and other resources helping me with my productivity! 

A HUGE and HEARTY thank you to...
