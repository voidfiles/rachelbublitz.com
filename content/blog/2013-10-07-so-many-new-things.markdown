title: So Many New Things
---

I have so many new scripts happening right now. It's strange because this isn't the way I normally work. Typically, I write one play until I'm 2 or 3 drafts in, and pleased with it. But now, I have 1st drafts, or half a draft of *four* plays! They're all one-acts, but they're *long* one-acts ranging from 30 minutes - 70 minutes, and they're all very, *very* different. How different? Well, I'll tell you...

I'm writing a comedic one-act about a mathletes team at a high school, with PG material and language and with *eight* characters (6 f, 2 m).

I have a first draft of a play that I'm probably calling *You Will Survive Me*, a one-act that is more on the dramatic side, and deals with abuse, and the relationship between mothers and daughters. It has 4 characters (4 f).

I'm half way through my first draft of *Clever Queen* which will hopefully be between 30 and 40 pages when I'm done. It's a children's play, as in a play for children to watch and/or preform in. Right now the cast has... 5, but that's probably going to get bigger. (as of now 1 f, 2 m, 2 f/m).

*Rosie, Bloody Rosie* (working title that will probably change) is my suspense/horror/serial killer play that'll hopefully be between 60-75 minutes, I have the first two scenes of this nailed down, and a outline of the rest. It has 5 characters (4 f, 1 m).

And those are the four I'm writing right now... My one-act for Geryon is starting to come together in my head, but I want to get further into these plays before I start a draft of that. Exciting! A little overwhelming! But that's what grad school is about, right? Pushing yourself, so that's what I'm doing.

Oh yes! And, the first topic for [PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/) will be announced this Friday at 9am! So I'll be writing a new ten-minute play this weekend. Fun!
