The month of May was very Christmas heavy for me. That's due to the fact that I was writing a bunch of new holiday shorts! I sent over three 10 minute plays to [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/) last year, and they liked them SO MUCH they wanted to publish a complete collection! Which meant that I needed to write more holiday shorts! Hoping to have something ready for the holiday season later this year, we agreed that the end of May would be perfect timing to get all my plays in. And so with the last bit of last winter's snow melting outside of my office I got to work. It was a hoot to complete this collection of quirky and weird new holiday plays, and something I think that would be a lot of fun for any school program looking to spice up their holiday show. Here's the full line-up of this soon-to-be-published collection:

### [*Holly, Jolly, & Extra Folly; a collection of eclectic holiday plays*](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/products/holly-jolly-extra-folly)

1. [*Mom's Ham*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/62099/moms-ham)  
2. *Who's Got Christmas Spirit??**  
3. *Santa's Old Friend**  
4. [*How Gretchen Stole Christmas*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/71515/how-gretchen-stole-christmas)  
5. [*Warm The Bones*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1353475/warm-bones)*  
6. *Reindeer Games**  
7. [*Oy, Oy, Oy, Merry Christmas!*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/71516/oy-oy-oy-merry-christmas)

*One of the four brand-spanking-new plays I wrote last month!

We got something for everyone in these plays! Lots of laughs, a fair bit of heart, and even some scares for the spooky lovers. Most of these are up in my [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/users/275/rachel-bublitz) page, if you'd like to get a jump start on reading. But if one of those plays is calling out to you, and it's not on New Play Exchange, [send me an email](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com)! Happy to share and help you get in the Christmas spirit way early!

I dedicated this collection to my Grandma, who passed a few years ago. She was hilarious and sarcastic and would have laughed pretty hard at me, her Jewish granddaughter, dedicating a collection of short Christmas plays to her, my Jewish grandmother. But it all just felt right. She was good enough to pass her wonderful sense of humor with me, after all.

As soon as the collection is up and ready at [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/), I'll be sure to post about it here, or [click right here to sign up for a notification from Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/products/holly-jolly-extra-folly)!

Happy Tuesday! And happy June! I can't believe it's already June! Oy vey!
