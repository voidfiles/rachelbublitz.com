+++

I'm heading to the Bay Area Friday! My very new play *HAPPILY* will kick of [Quantum Dragon Theatre](https://www.quantumdragon.org/)'s [Forge reading series](https://www.quantumdragon.org/the-forge-2017) on Monday the 8th! Yep, that is *this* Monday! Time apparently does not stop when you're on vacation.

The reading will be at the [Shotgun Studios](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shotgun+Studios/@37.869743,-122.289269,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x2e8a5b0907c1184d?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk7snwqLzYAhVU5mMKHTSfDfIQ_BIIgQEwCg) on University in Berkeley, at 7:30pm. You can get a pay-what-you-can ticket [here](https://www.quantumdragon.org/buy-tickets) or at the door (if you're reading this on facebook, click through for links). And I'm incredible happy (ha) to announce that the cast will be the same from the table reading we had last October, which includes the following rockstar actors: Reena: Stephanie Ann Foster, Erika Bakse, Jessica Rudholm, Matt Gunnison, and Jess Thomas, with stage directions being read by our fearless leader/director Melinda Marks. These guys *killed* the cold reading, I can't wait to see what they do after they have rehearsal time. Here's a bit more about the play:

>Reena has thrown every-thing she’s got into her fantasy novel, a project she’s been working on for her entire adult life, when fate throws her a curveball and she’s forced to sleep on her sister and brother-in-law’s couch. Now she’s caught between following her passion and being what everyone else considers an adult. She’s positive everything will work out her way if only she could stop flirting with her sister’s obviously unavailable new neighbor. As Reena shifts between her fantastic imagination and real life, she realizes that she has to fight the dragons of her own past if she’s going to get a happy ending to call her own.

I hope you can make it out! My trip will be packed with rehearsal and the reading, and I go home Tuesday, so if you want to see me and/or give me a hug, coming to the reading will be your best chance. 

And remember, *HAPPILY* is just the *first* play in the Forge reading series, check out the awesome line-up for the rest of the month:

Monday, January 15th, 2018 @ 7:30pm: *PROTOTYPE* by Christina Bauer, directed by Kari Barclay

Monday, January 22nd, 2018 @ 7:30pm: *CREATURE FEATURE* by Claire Ann Rice, directed by Tony Cirimele

Tuesday, January 30th, 2018 @ 7:30pm: *ACCOMMODATIONS* by Jennifer Lynne Roberts, directed by Jacinta Sutphin

Your best bet is to see them all, that way you won't miss anything. 

Happy Wednesday!
