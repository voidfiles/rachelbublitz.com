Lucky week thirteen and I just got finished reading [*ANNIE JUMP AND THE LIBRARY OF HEAVEN*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1401/annie-jump-and-library-heaven) by Reina Hardy on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard)! I am tickled pink by this play. It has so much to love, humor, fantastic characters, magic, science, *ALIENS*, and complex roles for women. Here's my full recommendation I posted on the New Play Exchange:

>" I have such a huge soft spot for this play. Magic, science, brilliant young women, aliens, and hope all rolled into one script. It's really funny and sweet, the dialogue bounces along, and I'd love to be best friends with any of the characters. A fantastic play for theater goers of all ages. Would love to see it produced.... Would also love to be a Librarian!"

It's a play I'm tempted to print out for my kids to also read, and I would leap at an opportunity to see it produced (and to bring them along!). Lots of folks will soon have that opportunity, *ANNIE JUMP AND THE LIBRARY OF HEAVEN* is having a Rolling World Premiere with NNPN at Renaissance Theaterworks in Milwaukee, Rorschach Theatre in Washington, DC, The Vortex in Austin, and Thrown Stone in Ridgefield. If you're near any of those theaters I highly recommend popping over to their website and getting your tickets. It's a delightful and wonder-filled show. I also think it would an amazing show at a high school or college, theater teaching artists, be sure to look up this play! It really has a lot to offer.
