title: Keep Me In The Loop
---

I am primarily a playwright, and this blog is here for my shameless self promotion... Mostly. After getting such great feedback from my BOA post, I wanted to let people know that I will gladly promote projects from local theatre in the Bay Area! If you have a show you want me to come and see or think I should promote on my blog, send me an email and I'll be happy to help you out! I'm still trying to get to know everyone out here in the theatre community, and I always love to hear about new shows!

Email me at [Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com). Thanks!
