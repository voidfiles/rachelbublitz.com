Yesterday was huge! And we received more money than any other day in the fundraiser so far! THANK YOU! 

We still have a tiny bit to go though, $1,278 to be exact. There's only 14 hours left in this campaign, help us reach our goal! Support awesome indie theater! So click on through and GIVE! Then tell your buddies to do the same.
