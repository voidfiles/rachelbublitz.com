### CASTING CALL-WYOMING THEATER FESTIVAL

ACTORS NEEDED FOR 3 PLAYS

6 Equity contracts and 12 non-Equity contracts are available. Housing is provided for all actors. Rehearsals begin Aug. 21 and the show closes Sept. 17.

Please send your headshot/resume to [dhodnett@sheridan.edu](mailto:dhodnett@sheridan.edu) by Friday, May 10th for consideration.

The Wyoming Theater Festival is seeking actors for a development production of 3 new plays.

Casting Breakdowns follow the descriptions below:

1. Kenneth Jones’s new play, “Hollywood, Nebraska,” directed by Scott Alan Evans, artistic
director of off-Broadway’s The Actors Company Theater (TACT). Jones’s play “Alabama
Story” premiered at Pioneer Theater Company in 2015 and will have had productions in 10 cities
by the spring of 2018. “Hollywood, Nebraska” is his latest play. 2 Equity contracts and 4 nonEquity
contracts are available for this play.

>“Hollywood, Nebraska” takes place in the panhandle of Nebraska, where two actresses of a
certain age are making a homecoming in their small town. Jane’s in from L.A. to check up on her
ailing mother. Andrea’s back from New York to bury her father. A romantic, rueful new comedy
about the urge to be creative, the itch to move away and the ache of reconnecting with the family
and feelings that you left behind.

2. Emmy award winner Mark Saltzman’s new musical, “Another Roll of the Dice,” directed
and choreographed by Larry Sousa, winner of LA Drama Critics Circle, and LA Ovation
awards. Mark Saltzman’s works have been performed coast-to-coast from Manhattan’s
Roundabout to the Pasadena Playhouse and beyond. “Dice” is his fourth play to be developed in
Wyoming. 2 Equity contracts and 4 non-Equity contracts are available for this musical.

>“Another Roll of the Dice” might well be called “More Guys, Other Dolls.” But this is not quite
a sequel to "Guys and Dolls," which was also based on Damon Runyon's famous Broadway
tales. “Dice” will present three separate Runyon tales enhanced, as “Guys and Dolls" was, with
songs of Frank Loesser, some rarely performed gems, most iconic songs from his catalog of hits, 
like “Heart and Soul,” "Baby, It’s Cold Outside,” “See What the Boys in the Back Room Will
Have," "Two Sleepy People." The songs and stories will be blended in the best tradition of
musical comedy style.

3. Gabrielle Sinclair’s latest work, “The Resolute: A Victorian Girl’s Guide to Baseball”
directed by Colleen Britt, resident director of Infinite Variety Productions, NYC. This will be
Britt’s 3rd production with the Wyoming Theater Festival. 2 Equity contracts and 4 non-Equity
contracts are available for this play.

>“The Resolute” takes us to an America scarred by the Civil War where, in upstate New York a
revolutionary experiment in education is commencing: The nation’s first liberal arts college for
women. Vassar, is opening its doors to 353 young female students from around the country. And
one student, Elizabeth, urged on by the women in her intensely political family, is determined to
make something of herself. So she does something big: She starts a baseball team for women.

Located in beautiful Sheridan, WY, the Wyoming Theater Festival is dedicated to launching new
plays and musicals as well as retooling worthy neglected works.

#### “HOLLYWOOD, NEBRASKA” CASTING BREAKDOWN

JANE, 40s. A talented L.A.-based actress, twice-divorced and ready for reinvention. Tough
exterior, defensive about where she is in her career but has a cool, laid back, independent
confidence of a leading lady you’d see on television. The sort of person who is used to being
right.

ALMA, 70s. Mother of Jane. Small-town widow. Not worldly, perhaps even narrow.
Everybody’s “mom” figure. Beneath her homespun wisdom and her passion for local tradition is
a bitterness about how life turned out.

ROBERT, early 50s. A widower, a carpenter/contractor native to Nebraska. Salt of the earth. An
idealized “regular guy” — a veteran, a great dad, entrepreneurial/self-employed and optimistic.
Can flirt but when exposed can be taciturn.

KATIE, 15-16 years old, in high school. Robert’s daughter, who wants to be an actress one day.
Optimistic. Eager to learn. The kind of kid you want to have as your daughter.

ANDREA, 40s. A New York actress clinging to the illusion that she is/was a successful actress.
No edit button. A delicious, dark-humored object of desire unlike anyone in this small-town. A
creature whose well of sadness/disappointment is deep. Ideally, an actress with piano/singing
skill but not a must.

LANCE, 30s, can look younger. Salt of the earth worker-bee. Not worldly, not deep. A catch
without knowing it. A survivor. Hides a hidden artistic talent. Ideally, an actor with piano skill
but not a must.

#### “ANOTHER ROLL OF THE DICE” CASTING BREAKDOWN

Here’s a quick breakdown for the six characters. They are all playing multiple characters as
described in detail further below.

In short, it’s this combo:

Two MUGS - 35-55

One GUY – 25-35

One DOLL – 25-35

One BOY - 18-25

One GIRL – 18-25

All actors must sing, move well, and be excellent at playing multiple comic characters. Note:
Legit sounding voices are not a necessity; actors with character voices are welcome.

THE TWO MUGS - CHARLIE MUG and MOOSE MUG are two classic Guys and Dolls gangster types. Baritone or
tenor, doesn’t really matter. Comedy chops do, especially playing multiple characters. Age 35-
50. All body types welcome.

GUY: Male, late 20’s - early 30’s. Handsome, trim, manly, a leading man type. Baritone or
tenor.

DOLL. Flashy, Broadway “doll,” womanly, attractive, mid-20’s – mid-30’s. Broadway
belt/mezzo.

GIRL: Classic musical comedy “ingénue” 18-22. Her slim girlishness should contrast with the
womanliness of DOLL. Mezzo or soprano OK.

BOY: Male 18-25. Classic musical comedy “boy.” Tenor would be nice, but light baritone is
OK. His adolescent build should contrast to the manliness of GUY.

#### “THE RESOLUTE” CASTING BREAKDOWN

GRACE, 18-24. Secretly biracial. And baseball fan. Student at Vassar.

HELEN, 18-24. Ambitious to a fault. Over eager. Afraid of failure. Will do anything to stay in
school. Nickname - Len. Student at Vassar.

ELIZABETH, 18-24. Daughter of abolitionists. Wants to be a lawyer. Makes everything
symbolic. Secretly Afraid of conflict. Student at Vassar.

CLARA, 18-24. Southern belle. Wants to feel strong, not fragile. Full, not hollow. Student at
Vassar.

ANNIE, 18-24. Widow. Dreamer. Wants to move on and live her life. Afraid of life on her
own. Student at Vassar.

MARIA, 40’s-50’s. Professor. First-year teacher. Famous. Astronomer. Wants to be alone and
hide but needs people. Wants to be comfortable around people. Needs rules. First year professor
at Vassar.
