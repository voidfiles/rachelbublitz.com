Fun story! Back in 2020, before the world shut down, before even Coronavirus had made much of a news splash, I got an amazing call from [Theatre Bay Area](https://www.theatrebayarea.org/) informing me that [*Ripped*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/ripped) was the recipient of the [2020 Will Glickman Award](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/theater/ripped-by-rachel-bublitz-wins-2020-will-glickman-award)! Weeks after I got the news, the world flipped upside down, as you probably remember and more important things were on everyone's minds. The conference, where I would have been awarded the prize, was canceled. I didn't pick out a pretty dress or hop on a plane or get to schmooze with all the fancy Bay Area theater artists.

Life went on, five years actually, and I noticed that this year's recipient of the Will Glickman Award, [Leah Nanako Winkler](https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/thirty-six-leah-nanako-winkler-glickman-20192018.php), got a nice little trophy.... And that got me interested because I had not received any type of trophy. After a quick internet search I discovered all the winners of the Will Glickman Award had a nice little trophy... Except for me. Which really, is very understandable considering the aforementioned global disaster.

... Now, do I need a nice little trophy? No. Do I want a nice little trophy? Listen, I'm human and I have flaws, and maybe this is one of them, because I did want a nice little trophy. So I sent a note to Theatre Bay Area, laying out all of these facts and you know what happened? They immediately had a nice little trophy made for me! And I, remember, essentially flawed human, absolutely love it. I like it so much I may put up a little shelf up in my office to properly show it off to my dogs.

The award winning World Premiere of [*Ripped*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/ripped) was produced by [Z Space](https://www.zspace.org/) in San Francisco of 2019. [*Ripped*](https://www.originalworksonline.com/ripped) has been published with [Original Works Publishing](https://www.originalworksonline.com/), where you can purchase and/or license the script.

What color shelf should I get? Green? Blue? Aquamarine?

Happy Thursday!
