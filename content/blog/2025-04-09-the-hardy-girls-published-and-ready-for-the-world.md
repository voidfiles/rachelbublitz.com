Want to know more about this mystery/comedy? Here's the synopsis:

>"*When Juno Hardy is sent to live in the town of Bayport with her cousin Fran, she is perplexed to find all its eccentric residents are holding onto the bygone era when her grandpa and his brother were teen detectives. But it’s not all wholesome picnics – and when a friend is wrongfully accused of a string of robberies, sarcastic Juno and her upbeat, earnest cousin must work together to solve the crime and clear their friend's name. Grab your magnifying glass and follow the twists and turns of this delightfully cheeky, flexible play inspired by the first Hardy Boys mystery.*"

*[The Hardy Girls](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/hardy-girls#get_scripts)* has a super flexible cast of 10 to 20 and runs between 100 and 120 minutes. The play also includes some of my all-time favorite lines, like:

>"*Good gracious, Fran, there’s another girl here! When did you and your mother get
another girl?*"

And:

>"*Stop. You absolutely cannot add rhyming to your quirks. I’m at my limit*."
