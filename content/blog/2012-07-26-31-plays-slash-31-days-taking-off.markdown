title: 31 Plays/31 Days Taking Off
---

Today is the day we push [The 31 Plays in 31 Days Project](http://31plays31days.com). We're attempting to create an internet storm of interest, and so far so good... We were at 211 last night, and we've jumped up to 228 over night. We have 6 days until the 1st, and we need your help to spread the word! Sign up, if you haven't already... Or, if you're not a playwright, tell people about us! [Tweet](https://twitter.com/31Plays31Days) about us (feel free to follow us too!), and like and share us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/31Plays31Days). We're growing bigger each day, but there are still folks out there who haven't heard about us yet. Get out your bullhorn and shout it out people! Thank you in advance.
