Today is a new day! I got some rest, went for a run, and I am ready to jump back through all the childcare hoops and make it to class! Tonight I have my Workshop in Short Plays class, and I'm hoping there will be no poetry writing involved.

This morning I dropped off my oldest at kindergarten for the first time, she was so excited she was dressed and ready for school two hours before it started. And as soon as we walked in the classroom she said, "Okay mom, you can go now." So I left. I put dinner in the slow cooker, took care of my errands, and had time for thinking... I'm 90% sure that for my translation project I'm going to translate the stories in Rudyard Kipling's "Just So Stories" into a series of short children's plays. And I find this very exciting.

I'm off to go pick up my daughter, and will post about tonight's class tomorrow.

Have a good Wednesday!
