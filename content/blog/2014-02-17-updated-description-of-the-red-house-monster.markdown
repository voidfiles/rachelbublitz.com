title: Updated Description of THE RED HOUSE MONSTER
---

Happy Monday! Now that I have a solid draft of *The Red House Monster*, my one-act play based on the Greek monster Geryon (commissioned by the [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/)), I have updated my blurb about it! Curious? You should be! Read all about it here: [http://www.sfolympians.com/?page_id=1842](http://www.sfolympians.com/?page_id=1842), my monster page on the SF Olympians' website, you'll also get more background on Geryon and my bio (yay!).

But, if you're lazy, and can't be bothered with links here's the new description:

>"Rachel Bublitzâ€™s one-act play, The Red House Monster, chronicles the story of Hannah Gold, a young lady living on an island off the coast of Massachusetts in the late 1800s, and the night that changed her life. Filled with small town lore, haunted houses, spirits, monsters, pistols, pie, and mysteries, it is a play that will keep you guessing just what is in the Red House, and who, in fact, you should be afraid of."

Exciting, isn't it? And strange? It's the strangest thing I've ever written I think, and I'm itching to get a table read of it so that I can find out if it even makes sense. Another fun aspect of this play is that it's only 45 pages long right now! Last year I had anxiety all year that the beast of *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* would go over the 2 hour time limit (it had started off at 145 pages!). It's nice to have wiggle room to grow the script, if need be. 

The reading of *The Red House Monster* is coming up on November 15th, to the [Exit Theatre](http://www.theexit.org/). I share the stage with Veronica Tjioe who is writing all about the Minotaur! Read all about her play here: [http://www.sfolympians.com/?page_id=1844](http://www.sfolympians.com/?page_id=1844), and get ready for November, because monsters are coming and you do not want to miss them.
