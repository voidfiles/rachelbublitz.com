More good news via the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard)! [Shaun Leisher](https://newplayexchange.org/users/1297/shaun-leisher), a producer, director, and dramaturg, just reached out to me asking permission to present two of my plays in an reading event later this month! AND where did he find both plays? Yep. The New Play Exchange! [*BLUE*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/200470/blue-monologue) and [*MY BODY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2541/my-body) will join the line-up for: [Want Change? Vote!: Artists Demanding Action](https://www.facebook.com/events/233441633994482/)!

You can catch both of these plays and the full line-up of readings, poetry, and music, on Tuesday September 25th from 6pm-9pm in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This is a *free* event too! They will be accepting donation, all of which will go to benefit [RAICES](https://www.raicestexas.org/). AND there will be volunteers from [NextGen America](https://nextgenamerica.org/) registering folks to vote as well!

This is SUCH a cool event, and I'm so honored to have my work be a part of it. ALSO very excited to have more success come out of my New Play Exchange membership. As a playwright operating without an agent, it's opened a LOT of doors for me.

Happy Tuesday! And vote! For reals. Vote.
