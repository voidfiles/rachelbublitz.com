title: A Review Of THE FANTASY CLUB
---

My first play and now my first review! [Sam Hurwitt](http://theidiolect.com/) is the editor-in-chief of Theatre Bay Area magazine and theatre critic for the Marin Independent Journal and KQED Arts, and he reviewed *The Fantasy Club*! Here are some of my favorite bits:

>"Pretty much every conversation between Frances and her old crush is exquisitely uncomfortable, as is Samâ€™s shameless flirting."

>"The less-imaginary sex scenes are hilariously awkward in comparison."
