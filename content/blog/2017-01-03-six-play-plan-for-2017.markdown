title: Six Play Plan For 2017!
---

Happy New Years! 

I hope that your holidays were merry and bright. I quite enjoyed my break from work. I spent a lot of snow filled days trapped inside with my children, there were puzzles and cards and Scrabble Junior and fights and fights and fights and fights and quite a few times when I forced them to play outside and leave me the hell alone. I've learned that when it comes to parenting that phrase "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger," has never been more true. But I survived! And I'm ready to tackle 2017 head on, which brings me to the first of many very exciting announcements for this coming year....

I'm writing six brand-spanking-new full length plays this year.

Yep.

SIX.

Six new plays.

Because if this crazy plan doesn't kill me, I'll certainly come out of 2017 a stronger writer.

Stay tuned in the next few days and weeks, because, like I said, a lot of exciting things are brewing over here, and slowly but surely I'll be telling you all about them. 

P.S. I made my submission mission by submitting 205 scripts in 2016!
