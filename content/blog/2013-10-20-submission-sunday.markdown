title: Submission Sunday!
---

How's your weekend? Mine has been pretty great. I went to a vintage clothing fair with one of my closest friends, a birthday party filled with MIT geniuses, got my fridge loaded up from a Costco trip, started a expansion of a play (I'm turning *You Will Survive Me* from a one-act to a full-length), and now I'm relaxing, sending out submissions and doing laundry. Easy, breezy, beautiful.

And you should send out some scripts too! I sent my one-act *Mother Of The Year* into [MadLab Theatre's Theatre Roulette](http://www.madlab.net/MadLab/roulette.html) (a short play festival), and I sent my full-length heavy hitter *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* to both [Red Theater](http://redtheater.org/scripts/red-play-writing-competition/), and [The Resident Theatre Company](http://theatre.fullcoll.edu/scm.asp?scmpageid=14). There are a ton of opportunities with deadlines coming up, get on it! Also, I don't post all the opps I come across here, but I do post them on my twitter feed and on my facebook page! So, if you want to keep up to date with all the opportunities that I know about follow me on twitter here: [http://twitter.com/RachelBublitz](http://twitter.com/RachelBublitz), OR like me on facebook here: [http://www.facebook.com/rachelnbublitz](http://www.facebook.com/rachelnbublitz). Or, even better do both!

Happy submitting and happy Sunday!
