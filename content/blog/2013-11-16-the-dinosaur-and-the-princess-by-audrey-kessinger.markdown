title: The Dinosaur And The Princess By Audrey Kessinger
---

I'm rewriting, really I am. I was working away in my room when Audrey, my five year old daughter, walked in and announced that she wanted to write a play. Since she can't write or type yet, that means I had to put my script down and write hers. Things you do for love.

I want it!

I remember something. I remember that we said to play chase! Let’s go play chase now.

*PRINCESS runs all over the park, DINOSAUR chases PRINCESS.*

PRINCESS (CONTINUED)
Let’s go tell our moms that we played chase.

*End of play.*
