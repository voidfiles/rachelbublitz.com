We only have 58 hours left on our [kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allterraintheater/the-fantasy-club-by-rachel-bublitz) for this August's production of *The Fantasy Club* and we still have $460 to raise! If we don't meet our 4k goal by Friday at 11:59 pm, we won't get *ANY MONEY*! That means we need you! Dig deep friends! Give what you can and share with all those lovely people in your life! Together we will make this sexy play happen!
