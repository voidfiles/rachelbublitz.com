title: 'First Play: NO MAP'
---

With six new full length plays to write and with it already being the *fifth* day of the new year, I had better get cracking. Up first: NO MAP; three college friends on a after graduation road trip before they spread out in the world and start their adult lives. I'm excited for the challenge of writing a play which takes place only in and around a car, well at least that's the plan for now, we'll see how close I stick to it. 

And now, time for some writing!
