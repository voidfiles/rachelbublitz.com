Interested in publishing or producing one of my scripts? Here's what you need to do:

To request any of the scripts listed above send an email to: [Rnbublitz@gmail.com](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com)

Please have "script request" in the subject line of the email. In the body include which play or plays you are interested in and the theatre or school requesting the script.

This information can also be found in the "Contact Me," as well as the "Plays" section of my website. For a list of my completed works, with summaries go to the "Plays" tab.
