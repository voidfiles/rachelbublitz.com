title: Gearing Up To Write 31 Plays This August
---

This August is going to be one wild ride; I'll have my first full-length play up and running (*The Fantasy Club*), rehearsals for our Fringe show (*Babies, The Ultimate Birth Control*), grad school starting, oh, and I'll be writing 31 plays and running the [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/) Project for all of our lovely playwrights... Not to mention feeding, clothing, and taking care of my kids. In case you're wondering, of all those things running the project is the hardest part. But let's get back to writing the plays... Because that might be the most fun!

This year, considering all of the wonderful things filling up my schedule, my plan is to finish my plays ASAP... I've been stockpiling ideas along with some competitions that have themes, and come August 1st I will burrow myself into a hole hoping to complete the challenge before I have to emerge. I know that's impossible, mostly because of the two kids that rely on me for everything, but a girl can dream, can't she?

If you also think writing 31 plays next month is your idea of a good time, sign up for the challenge! I'm 100% sure it's going to be a hoot.
