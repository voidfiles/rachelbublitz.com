[Plan-B Theatre](planbtheatre.org)'s [(in)divisible](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/indivisible-tickets-31307655039) opened last night at the Rose Wagner in downtown Salt Lake. The show is a response to the response of the election, 12 local playwrights were charged to write two five-minute plays, one from a liberal perspective, the other from a conservative, without any names named, as in no Clinton, Trump, Obama, Sanders, etc. The plays have been weaved together to create a piece of theater that's hoping to break down the "sides" we've chosen in politics and create space for us to talk to one another like people again. There's a fantastic cast of local actor all-stars (Joe Debevc, Lily Hye Soo Dixon, Dee-Dee Darby-Duffin, April Fossen, Mark Fossen, Bijan Hosseini, Bryan Kido, Tito Livas, Jayne Luke, Shane Mozaffari, JJ Neward, Nicki Nixon, Isabella Reeder, Matthew Sincell, Darryl Stamp, Jason Tatom, and Alicia Washington), and I hear that they killed last night.

Now if you're thinking all of that sounds pretty amazing and you want in on this theater action, I have sad news for you... Yes, the show runs through June 18th, but at this point is completely sold out. That's right, the entire run is SOLD OLD folks. There's a wait list, and you can learn more about that [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/indivisible-tickets-31307655039). Putting on your best puppy dog eyes and waiting at the theater might also be an option, though I'm not sure how well it would work. Good luck getting in! And congrats to Plan-B Theatre and everyone involved with (in)divisible, selling out is no easy feat!

If you're one of the lucky ones with tickets, maybe I'll see you at the theater!
