title: 'Local Opportunities For Playwrights! #sftheater #bayarea #pwopp'
---

It's come to my attention that there are a number of super rad playwriting opportunities for local Bay Area writers right now, and if you don't know about them, you really should. Take a look:

##San Francisco Theater Pub's March Show - ON THE SPOT - deadline March 1, 2015

[San Francisco Theater Pub](https://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/) is taking resumes from playwrights, directors, and actors for their March show, [ON THE SPOT](https://sftheaterpub.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/theater-around-the-bay-a-call-for-playwrights-directors-and-actors/). I've never not had a blast at a SF Theater Pub show and so I highly recommend throwing your name in the mix. Here are the details from their website:

####ON THE SPOT
A Night of Brand New Works by Emerging Playwrights!

Seven playwrights are put “on the spot” and given 24 hours to write a new ten minute play. They are assigned two-four actors, a director, and given a line of dialogue, a prop, and one set piece they must incorporate into their script. TheaterPub will produce these plays at PianoFight’s incredible new venue on March 23, 24, 30 & 31.

Are you a playwright looking to challenge yourself? Are you a director who is quick on your feet and full of ideas? Are you an actor who likes performing in bars? Then this show was MADE for you!

If you’re interested, please email Artistic Director Meg Trowbridge ([thesingingwriter@gmail.com](mailto:thesingingwriter@gmail.com)) with the following information by March 1st:

* Name
* Contact info
* Resume/Headshot
* Desired roles (playwriting, directing, or acting- or combination)

Confirmation you are available on the following days:
Rehearsals: March 14, 15, 21, 22 (12pm-6pm),
Performances: March 23, 24, 30 & 31 (6:30pm-10:00pm)

We’d love to see some new faces on stage or on the page, so if you have a friend you know who is looking to get involved with us, please forward them this post!

##Those Women Productions - In Plain Sight: Stories you never knew you never knew - deadline March 8, 2015

The show will open Labor Day weekend 2015 and will run for 7-9 performances. We are looking for scripts that fit our mission to bring hidden truths of gender and power to the stage. Plays should offer new takes on old tales, reimagining a story from world mythology and/or classic literature.

All plays must stand on their own and have the potential to appeal to a broad audience, including those not familiar with your source material.

Author’s name should not appear anywhere on the script but each page of the script should include the title of your play. Number your pages please!
* Include the title(s) of your play(s), the author’s name and your full contact information in the body of your email, and please affirm that you are a San Francisco Bay Area resident and would be available to attend some rehearsals and one or more performances of your play if it is selected.

* Publication of your script following the readings by the EXIT Press.

What happens after you hit ‘send’?

Submissions will be read by the Literary Manager and a committee of script readers between February 15 and April 15, 2015. From the committee evaluations and scores of the proposals, the Literary Manager will then select the top proposals from this process. These will then be read blind and ranked by L&U’s founding production team (Rachel Bublitz, Tracy Held Potter, and Claire Rice). After they are ranked, they will be unblinded and the final proposals will be chosen and playwrights will be contacted.

Thank you for your interest, and good luck!
