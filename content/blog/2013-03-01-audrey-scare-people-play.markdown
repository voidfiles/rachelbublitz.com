My little girl just wrote her first play! She's 4 (she'll be 5 in two weeks). It's kinda hilarious... I asked her permission and she told me I could post it on my blog! So, here it is....

SCARE PEOPLE: I AM GOING TO GO INTO THE REFRIGERATOR, BECAUSE THE SUN IS RISING!

*SCARE PEOPLE goes into the refrigerated, and closes the door. AUDREY opens the refrigerator door, SCARE PEOPLE opens it, this happens several more times.*

SCARE PEOPLE: YOU’LL HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT!

*AUDREY throws shoes at SCARE PEOPLE.*

AUDREY: I’LL TRICK YOU, SCARE PEOPLE!

*AUDREY gets a stick of butter out of the refrigerator, opens the door and throws the butter out. SCARE PEOPLE doesn’t go out to get the butter. SCARE PEOPLE gets back into the refrigerator and closes the door.*
