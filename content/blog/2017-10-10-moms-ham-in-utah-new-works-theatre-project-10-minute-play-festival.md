title = "MOM'S HAM In Utah New Works Theatre Project 10 Minute Play Festival"

+++

My ten-minute play *Mom's Ham*, which was written for [PlayGround](http://playground-sf.org/) and performed as a staged reading on the [Berkeley Rep](https://www.berkeleyrep.org/) stage back in 2013, has been selected for [Utah New Work Theatre Project](https://www.utahnewworkstheatreproject.org/)'s 10-Minute Play Festival! The festival will take place in Provo, Utah November 15-18th, and my director is Brittany N. Bohn. I'm always happy to be included in a festival, of course, but I'm really glad to have the opportunity to meet more local theater artists here in Utah. 

If you're bummed you missed out on the call for writers and directors and would like to be involved, you're in luck! This week we have auditions for the whole festival! Auditions are October 12th, starting at 6pm, and October 14th, starting at 10am. Get all the info here, [on the facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/168786803676658/?acontext=%7B%22action_history%22%3A%22[%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22page%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22page_upcoming_events_card%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A[]%7D]%22%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D) (and if you're reading this *on* facebook, click through for the link).
