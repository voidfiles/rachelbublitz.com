Last Saturday was [Rose Exposed](http://roseexposed.org/): Breaking News, where [Plan-B Theatre](https://planbtheatre.org/) produced my ten-minute play *THE FINAL DEBATE*. It was such a fulfilling experience, I was spoiled with a great director, [Jennifer Kokai](http://www.jenniferkokai.com/), and three amazing actors; Dee-Dee Darby-Duffin, Katie Jones Nall & Isabella Reeder. Here are some shots from the production:

It made me miss the ten-minute format, which I haven't been writing as much since I left the [PlayGround](http://playground-sf.org/) Writers Pool.

[*THE FINAL DEBATE*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/206537/final-debate) tackles gun control, and the horrifying episodes of gun violence across our country's schools. Please [email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) if you're interested in reading it, or you can [find it here on the New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/206537/final-debate).

One more until Friday folks!
