Today is the day! Today from 6pm - 7pm (mountain time!) Jamie Wilcox, artistic director of the [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre), and I will be interviewed on [KRCL](http://www.krcl.org/)'s [RadioActive](http://www.krcl.org/shows/radioactive/)! And that's not all! There will also be scenes from [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119869/cheerleaders-vs-aliens) being performed by the actors! You can listen to 90.9, if you're in Salt Lake, 96.7, if you're in Park City, or stream the show online at [KRCL.org](http://www.krcl.org/) if you're in far off places. Busy tonight? Never fear friends, tomorrow I'll post the link giving you the ability to play back the episode at any time and as many times as you like depending on how enthusiastic you are.

Yay! Now I gotta go figure out how not to sound like an idiot on the radio!
