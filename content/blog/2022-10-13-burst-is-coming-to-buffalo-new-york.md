[*Burst*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst) is coming to Buffalo, New York, and so am I! *Burst*'s World Premiere opens with [Alleyway Theatre](https://www.alleyway.com/) on Wednesday, October 26, with previews starting the Friday, October 21. I fly out next week for final dress, and will be in Buffalo through opening night. I've been developing *Burst* since 2016, with the help of theaters around the country, and I am so proud to finally get to see the play fully realized on stage.

Want to know more about the play? So glad you asked...

>"Sarah is an extraordinary human being on the verge of saving the planet from her cushy office in Silicon Valley. At the helm of one of the fastest growing tech companies in history—a company she built herself from scratch—she is about to announce a major breakthrough that will make her richer, famous-er, and prove that she was right all along: biodegradable plastic. Oh, and tonight she also has to prep for tomorrow’s lawsuit, sooth her frustrated business partner, and fend off an eager journalist hungry for a scoop. It’s all in a night’s work on the climb to success."

*Burst* is being directed by by Daniel F Lendzian, with the acting talents of Tracie Lane Thomason, Aleks Malejs, and Christine Turturro.

It is a bullet train of a play that kicks your teeth in for good measure. If you are anywhere near Buffalo, New York, please come out and say hi! And tell your friends!

If you're no where near Buffalo, but the play sounds too good to ignore, please find it on the [New Play Exchange](ttps://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst). This is *Burst*'s world premiere, and I am thrilled to chat about future productions!
