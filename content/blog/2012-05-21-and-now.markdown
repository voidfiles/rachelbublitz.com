title: "And Now, Re-Writes..."
---

Last week I wrote 5 plays in just 5 days, this week? Re-writing! Very exciting stuff I know. Actually, I kinda love rewriting so I'm excited. First on my plate is the short I wrote with all gender neutral characters for [this](http://www.papercuttheatre.co.uk/) opportunity I came across a few weeks ago. I'm also hoping to work on several other short plays so that I can send them out soon. And finally, I would love to get to work on "The Fantasy Club" before the weekend. I got some notes from my thoughtful director, [Tracy Held Potter]( http://www.allterraintheater.org), and I would like to get to them before we start rehearsals for the reading!

There are only two more weeks until the staged reading on June 4th! I hope you can come, and I hope that you bring friends. It's a comedy, so I need as many butts in chairs as I can so the laughter keeps flowing. Did you know that when people are in a larger audience they feel more comfortable laughing? True story. Click [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/284394794968889/) to RSVP for the reading at the Off Market Theater in San Francisco. Be there!

Okay, enough blogging, on to editing.
