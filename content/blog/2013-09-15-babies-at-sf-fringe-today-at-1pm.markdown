title: BABIES at SF Fringe Today at 1pm
---

[BABIES, The Ultimate Birth Control](https://www.facebook.com/events/158170084370589/) happens AGAIN! You do NOT want to miss this hilarious show. AND we have a new comment on our review page:

From sfkoolbrit:

>"“Terrifyingly Hilarious Plays about Parenting!” – This blurb really sums up this amazing, wonderful and yes, hilarious, set of short plays with brilliant performances by a wonderful cast, not to mention great writing and directing. This show is “not to be missed” so get your tickets today because tonight’s performance (9/14/13) was sold out."

You don't even have to take my word for it! Listen to sfkoolbrit! I'm pretty positive that this afternoon's performance will sell out, BUT have no fear, because 25% of the tickets are sold at the door! The show is at 1pm, get there early, and get a seat!

After today we'll have one more performance, Tuesday 9/17 at 9pm. Buy tickets in advance here: [http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/390070](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/390070), or try your luck at the door!
