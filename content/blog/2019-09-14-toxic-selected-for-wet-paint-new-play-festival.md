Chris and Brandon, the two teenage football playing characters from my one-act [*TOXIC*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/123895/toxic) will get a chance to live again on stage, this time in New York City! Wet Paint New Play Festival '19 runs September 26th - October 6th at [The New Ohio Theatre](https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+Ohio+Theatre/@40.7325797,-74.0081837,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x6ae15a64f59c7f46!8m2!3d40.7325797!4d-74.0081837). My director has been confirmed, AC Horton, the Associate Artistic Director at Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, and soon soon soon we will have a cast!

I am thrilled to have new work with Wet Paint this year, last year they premiered my ten-minute [*REALLY ADULT*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/116343/really-adult), and though I wasn't able to see the production I heard a lot of great things. This year, the theme was "walls" and I knew right away when I saw their call that *TOXIC* was the play I'd throw their way.

In *TOXIC*, football is life, and boys are men, at least they're supposed to be.... Chris is having a day the worst day of his young life, he’s been dumped by his girlfriend, and is possibly kicked off the football team, when he accidentally hits a raccoon. When he discovers the animal is dead everything proves too much and Chris falls to pieces, which prompts Brandon, his best friend and most true worshiper, to follow suit. Because if the star of your life isn’t a star, what does that make you? Toxic is a fast ride about status, masculinity, and how people are and are not allowed to behave.

*TOXIC* was produced earlier this summer at [Wasatch Theatre Company](https://www.wasatchtheatre.org/), and it's so exciting for it to be back on stage! And this time around just might include some really interesting casting choices.... But for that and ticket information you will have to come back! I will be posting more information as soon as it is confirmed. For now make sure you carve out time at the end of September/beginning of October so you can catch one of the performances!
