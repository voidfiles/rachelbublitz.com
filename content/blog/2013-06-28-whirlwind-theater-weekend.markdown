title: Whirlwind Theater Weekend
---

I've just got back from vacation, I was down in Southern California (Santa Barbara, San Diego, and LA) visiting friends and family. I drove home yesterday (one adult + two kids +6 hour drive = stress), and oddly enough I leave *again* on Tuesday! My life is so busy... Anyway, this is how I'm spending my four days home before I am away again...

Tonight I'm seeing [Bigger Than A Breadbox](https://www.facebook.com/BTaBTheatreCo?fref=ts)'s production of ['TIS PITY SHE'S A WHORE: A World Premiere Adaptation](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/399988#comments). I bought my ticket nice and early luckily, because their entire run sold out! Congratulations guys!

Tomorrow, I'll be at the [San Francisco Olympians' Festival](http://www.sfolympians.com/) photo shoot and then recording podcasts the rest of the day....

Sunday, I'll be recording podcasts all day again, woo! Although I am bummed that I'll be missing Pride this year, I have a feeling it's going to be very, very big.

Monday is the staged reading of [*Terrible People*](https://www.facebook.com/events/343655022423837/) my one-act comedy about lady killers. Not men who are great with women, but ladies that kill people. Hopefully the BART strike won't keep everyone away. If you're free and are able to get there, it will be downstairs at the [Shelton Theater](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=shelton+theater+sf&fb=1&gl=us&hq=shelton+theater&hnear=0x80859a6d00690021:0x4a501367f076adff,San+Francisco,+CA&cid=0,0,18321453481198214563&ei=BFGdUbSZLozqiwLUoID4Dw&ved=0CKYBEPwSMAA), the address is 533 Sutter St. Starts at 7:30pm.

Phew! So, basically non-stop fun until I jump on a plane (thank God we're flying) and go on our next adventure!
