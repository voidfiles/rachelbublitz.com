Happy October!

I have some fun news to share..........(drum roll)........

I have been named the Resident Playwright for the [Egyptian YouTheatre](https://egyptiantheatrecompany.org/index.php/youtheatre)!

(sounds of celebrations and playwright joy)

The Egyptian YouTheatre has certainly felt like my home since I made the move to Utah, they've commissioned three of my plays: [*Cheerleaders VS. Aliens*](https://www.pioneerdrama.com/SearchDetail.asp?pc=CHEERLEADE&id=0), [*The Night Witches*](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/the-night-witches), and [*The Summer I Howled*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/529011/summer-i-howled). And, have produced many of my one-acts including [*Ghost House*](https://www.playscripts.com/play/4701) and [*Operation Chicken Takeover*](https://www.playscripts.com/play/4985). I have had the pleasure of teaching both playwriting and acting at the Egyptian YouTheatre, as well as new play development workshops during summer camps. It's where most of my plays for young audiences are heard out loud for the first time. Egyptian YouTheatre artistic director Jamie Wilcox and I felt like the time had come to make us official.

So what does it mean? Workshops! Showcases! Development! Productions! It's a pretty sweet deal, and I can't wait to jump in this coming Spring and work on a new play, my first, as the official Resident Playwright. Wooo!

(more celebratory sounds)

Happy Friday!
