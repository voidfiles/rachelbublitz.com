This is not a drill! I am only ten submissions away from hitting my 400 submission goal for 2017! TEN SHY GUYS! Should I do a countdown? I think I need to do a countdown...

Submission #390 was sent off to [Blue Pearl Theatrics](https://bluepearltheatrics.com/). They're looking for un-published and un-produced ten-minute plays with four or less characters, I send them my ten-minute play *The Garden*. There's no deadline listed on their website, so I'd say the sooner with the sending is probably better. I found this opportunity the the [NYC Playwrights Blog](https://nycp.blogspot.com/), which is a blog I highly recommend following if you're in the market for a fun-ton of submission opportunities. 

Off to rewrites now. Be sure to check back as I count down the smashing of my #submissionmission!!!!
