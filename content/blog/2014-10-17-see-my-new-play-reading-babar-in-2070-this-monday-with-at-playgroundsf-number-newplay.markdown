title: 'See My New Play READING BABAR IN 2070 This Monday With @PlayGroundSF #newplay'
---

Exciting news! My play *Reading Babar in 2070* was selected for [PlayGround](http://playground-sf.org/monday/)'s Planet Earth New Play Festival! That means this Monday (October 20th) you, yes you(!), can see it along with five other brand new plays. Isn't it nice to have plans already for those dull Monday nights?

Here's the full line up:

*The Announcement* by William Bivins, directed by Rebecca Ennals

*Reading Babar in 2070* by Rachel Bublitz, directed by Michael French

*Preapocalyptica* by Erin Panttaja, directed by Delia MacDougall

*The Bake Sale* by Mandy Hodge Rizvi, directed by Jennifer King

*The Android and the Bishop* by Kirk Shimano, directed by Jeffrey Lo

*The Universe on Ice* by Maury Zeff, directed by Jim Kleinmann

The show will start at 8pm, and it all happens in Berkeley at the [Berkeley Rep](http://www.berkeleyrep.org/)! 

There will be an encore performance of these plays down at Stanford on the following day, Tuesday October 21st (more details soon!), but be sure to keep your eyes out for that too!
