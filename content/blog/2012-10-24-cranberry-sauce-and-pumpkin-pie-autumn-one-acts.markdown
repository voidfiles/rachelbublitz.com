As I posted earlier, [Love Creek Productions](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Love-Creek-Productions/58978756369?fref=ts) is including my short play GHOST STORY in their evening of one-acts for next month! The show has three performances; November 16th at 8pm, November 17th at 8pm, and November 18th at 7pm. And the performances will take place at [The Producer's Club](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=358+West+44th+Street,+new+york&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x89c25853986baac7:0x2f70c1aa3c513142,358+W+44th+St,+New+York,+NY+10036&gl=us&ei=966IUP34KOzsiwKLjYCoBg&ved=0CBwQ8gEwAA) in New York! This will be my first work done in New York, and I'm pretty excited. If you're in the neighborhood, check out the show! Tickets are $15, and you can call 212-769-7973 to make a reservation.
