title: AMAZING news, MY BODY in another reading!

This afternoon I got the best email ever....

Yep! MY BODY will join the line up for SLUT this October over in DC! And they said *such* nice things... Oooh, it feels good. It was tense for a minute or two, when I wasn't sure it would be alright for it to be a part of both programs. But, the folks with [Repro Rights!](http://pitchengine.com/reprorights/repro-rights-a-choice-evening-of-theatre-to-benefit-planned-parenthood) and [The Disreputables](http://www.disreputables.org/index.html) both gave me the okay! Yay!

Going to be in DC in October? You've *got* to see this show! Here are the details:

###SLUT 

Catch us next at SLUT, a festival of short works inspired by the War on Women - part of the UNmute! staged reading series.
