Last week I requested to write for the [365 Women A Year: A Playwriting Project](https://365womenayear.wordpress.com/), and I was approved to write for both of the women I sent in for! So this year, on top of my other projects, I'll be writing a new play based on [Adelaide Herrmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Herrmann), a magician and Vaudeville performer known as "The Queen of Magic," AND a play based on [Nancy Wake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wake), a secret agent from the Second World War. You might be thinking, "Wait, Rachel, you already wrote a play based on Nancy Wake for the first [Loud & Unladylike Festival](http://loudandunladylike.tumblr.com/)," and yes I did, it's called *ONCE A SPY* and after some editing, that's exactly the play I'll be submitting!

I'm excited to be working on *ONCE A SPY* again, and to get to know a new historical woman and write about her. If you're curious about how you can get involved with the 365 Women A Year: A Playwriting Project, check out their website: [https://365womenayear.wordpress.com/](https://365womenayear.wordpress.com/), they're taking proposals all year and plays aren't due until December 31, 2018.

Happy Monday everyone!
