Get out your calendars and save the date: I'm returning to the Bay Area for a reading of *HAPPILY* with [Quantum Dragon Theatre](https://www.quantumdragon.org/) January 8th! And, even more exciting, I have a director!! Melinda Marks has signed on to direct the reading and I can't wait! Melinda directed my reading of *ONCE A SPY* at the [Loud & Unladylike](http://loudandunladylike.tumblr.com/) festival, and I'm excited to get to work with her again. 

What's this play *HAPPILY* about anyway, you wonder? Well, lucky for you I've been tinkering with a blurb all day...

>"Reena has thrown everything she’s got into her fantasy novel, a project she’s been working on for her entire adult life, when fate throws her a curveball and she’s forced to sleep on her sister and brother-in-law’s couch. Now she’s caught between following her passion and being what everyone else considers an adult. She’s positive everything will work out her way if only she could stop flirting with her sister’s obviously unavailable new neighbor. As Reena shifts between her fantastic imagination and real life, she realizes that she has to fight the dragons of her own past if she’s going to get a happy ending to call her own."

*HAPPILY* will have its first public staged reading January 8th at the Shotgun Studios in Berkeley at 7:30pm. Cast announcements and more excitement from me is coming, so check back as we get closer! Also, plan on being at the reading, I want to squeeze as many Bay Area theater friends as I can!
