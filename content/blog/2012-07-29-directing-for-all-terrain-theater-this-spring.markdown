title: Directing For All Terrain Theater This Spring
---

I will be directing [All Terrain Theater](http://www.allterraintheater.org/)'s 2013 Women In Solidarity coming up this spring. Exciting, right? I really enjoyed the show last April, and I can't wait to work some more with [Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2) and all the other folks involved. More details as we get closer!
