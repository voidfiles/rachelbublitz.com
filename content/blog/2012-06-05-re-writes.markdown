I know I said I'd give it a few days, but I just couldn't. I started diving into re-writing THE FANTASY CLUB a few hours ago, and I find myself excited and terrified. This play has gone through some major changes from it's first draft. Each time I take it apart it gets better, without a doubt. But, I always have this feeling in the pit of my stomach, what if it doesn't get better? What if this time I take it apart and I lose some of what people like about it? And I guess I always will. I can't please everyone, and there will always, always, always be people who think it should be different. The best I can do is to serve the play, and I really truly think I'm doing that. Okay, I'm going to hold my breath and jump. One, two, three, GO!
