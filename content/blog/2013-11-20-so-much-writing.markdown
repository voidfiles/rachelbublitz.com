title: So Much Writing!
---

Today which started out being all about laundry, dishes, and making my house livable again, actually turned into a very productive writing day. Isn't it great when things sneak up on you like that? Yesterday I started putting words down for next year's Monster play Geryon, and then today I fixed what I had written and wrote a bunch more! And even better, I came up to walls because I realized that there were a few choices I needed to make before continuing! I also got a few books about small towns after I got many fabulous recommendations from friends, and so I am feeling great about my monster!

Also, I fixed a lot of problems with *Rosie, Bloody Rosie*! My lady-killer horror-play. And I kept trading back and forth which play I tinkered with, as I was faced with questions, and they were two really fun worlds to bounce back and forth from. AND, I've been told by the great [Anthony Clarvoe](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCwQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAnthony_Clarvoe&ei=j26NUsieNKWejAKsqoDADA&usg=AFQjCNGOhKQ8vkFT2PUgV7Q5ZiDHyVZWtg&sig2=m2GcD7KiYTVS9Wkfwe_d3Q&bvm=bv.56987063,d.cGE) that when you can procrastinate writing one play by working on another, you're in pretty good shape. So hooray for writing!
