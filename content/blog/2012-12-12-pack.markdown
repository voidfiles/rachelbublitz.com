What's your week like? I'm a tad busy over here... Packing like mad all day... Going to the [SF Olympian Fest](http://www.sfolympians.com/) tonight, tomorrow, *and* Friday... *Moving Saturday!* And then hitting up [Playwright's Foundation](http://www.playwrightsfoundation.org/index.php?p=1)'s One Minute Play Festival on Sunday... No big deal.

I went last Thursday and caught these three new plays at the Olympians Fest:

Mnemosyne and Themis, or The Broken Frame by Larissa Archer, Mnemosyne and Themis, or Leaving Earth by Susan Sobeloff, and Athena, The Musical by Roberta D’Alois and Marilyn Harris Kriegel, with lyrics by Roberta D’Alois and Marilyn Harris Kriegel, with music by Roberta D’Alois. 

It was a blast and Thursday sold out completely, so show up early! Tonight I'm seeing Coeus and Creos or 12.12.12 by Evelyn Jean Pine, and Hades by Robert and Benjamin Cooper (directed by the lovely [Tracy Held Potter](http://www.allterraintheater.org/?q=node/2)). 

Tomorrow's plays are... Tethys or In The Deep by Meghan Kathleen O’Connor, and Demeter or In the Silence of Tangerine Groves by Patricia Milton. Friday's are... Oceanus or The Death of All Dolphins by Evan Winchester, and Poseidon or Caenis and Poseidon, by Bridgette Dutta Portman. I can't wait! Did you know that there's voting, raffles, *and* prizes? 

Saturday we move back to Berkeley! We found a nice little apartment in West Berkeley, and I am *so* relieved (I don't have to cancel Christmas now!). 

And Sunday is sure to be super rad with the One Minute Play Festival. It features plays by:

Joan Holden, Chris Chen, Anthony Clarvoe, Lauren Gunderson, Aaron Loeb, Chinaka Hodge, J.C. Lee, Eugenie Chan, Trevor Allen, Tim Bauer, William Bivins, Erin M. Bregman, Victoria Chong Der, Megan Cohen, Bennett Fisher, Elizabeth Gjelten, Garret Jon Groenveld, Daniel Heath, Robert Henry Johnson, Lynne Kaufman, Jeffrey Lo, Jonathan Luskin, Katie May, Patricia Milton, Marisela Treviño Orta, David Perez, Evelyn Jean Pine, Kenn Rabin, Geetha Reddy, Kate E. Ryan, Steven M. Salzman, Marissa Skudlarek, Jonathan Spector, Aimee Suzara, Brian Thorstenson, Arisa White, Kim Yaged, & Ignacio Zulueta.

Hope to catch you at some awesome indie theatre!
