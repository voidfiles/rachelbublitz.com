title: Mixtapes Volume One TONIGHT 10:30pm San Jose Rep
---

![Postcard for Mixtapes Volume One.](/images/mixtapes.jpg)

For four performances only (the first one being TONIGHT) [Mixtapes Volume One](https://www.facebook.com/events/197566687084682/) at [SJReal](http://www.sjrep.com/experience/real/). The show is at 10:30pm, and I will be there! There other shows are tomorrow (9/14), and next Friday and Saturday (9/20 and 9/21) and they are all at 10:30pm.

This is a show built off of translated songs. A very fun project thought up by [Peter Hsieh](http://peter-hsieh.com/Home_Page.html). The other writers involved (other than Peter and myself) are, Amber Sommerfeld, [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/), and [Jeremy Cole](http://jeremycole.org/). It will be lots of fun! And there will be a Q & A after, so if you do make it, you can badger all the artists involved after!

Hope you make it out!
