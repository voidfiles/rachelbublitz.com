title: Thirty Three Submissions During January
---

My computer broke! I was without it for a week, and that is my only excuse for not posting. I tried to keep busy, and let's see how I did....

Well for the month of January I submitted thirty three times! What? Yep, I'm a little ahead of the game, not as much as I'd like, but what are you gonna do... I am not sure that February will be quite as productive, with working, grad school, taking care of my kiddos, and ya know, being a person... Probably won't be much of a person next month, but that is to be expected some times. 

But here we go! It's the year of 365 submissions, and I have only 332 to go!
