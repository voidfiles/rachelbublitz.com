So happy to share this wonderful poster for [*BURST*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/138560/burst), which will be coming to the [Pasadena Playhouse](https://www.pasadenaplayhouse.org/event/mach33/) April 3rd, a part of [Caltech's MACH 33; festival of new science driven plays](http://tacit.caltech.edu/mach33/current)! The reading will be directed by Miranda Stewart, and will start at 7:30pm.

I've had the luxury of working around the country on *BURST*, and I've been using notes from all over to streamline the play. This go around I've also gotten to bounce ideas off of a real live chemist, Aidan Fenwick, and so watch out science! Adding in this extra layer of real live chemistry is going to give the play so much depth and specificity. I just love this play so much!

If we're looking at things as a progression, my play [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) punches you in the gut, but *BURST* is a punch right to the face. A fast and furious punch that I am SO excited to share. Getting the chance to share it at the Pasadena Playhouse is a dream come true. Come and get punched with me! It's two days before my birthday, so it'll count as your birthday present to me.

Wash your hands, do your best to stay healthy, and see you April 3rd!
