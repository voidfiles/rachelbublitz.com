This week has been a big ol' theater blur. I helped out with the [Wyoming Theater Festival](http://www.whitneyarts.org/about-us/wyoming-theater-festival/) 2017 auditions here in Salt Lake, I had another reading of *Let's Fix Andy* (with two artistic directors in attendance - woo!), AND busted out a draft of my third play in my [six new play plan](https://rachelbublitz.com/2017/01/03/six-play-plan-for-2017/), *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*! I need a nap. And probably some water, theater activities can be very dehydrating in this high dessert. But that means I'm 1/2 through my crazy play writing goal for the year. I'd say a nap has been well earned. Now I'm off to snooze.
