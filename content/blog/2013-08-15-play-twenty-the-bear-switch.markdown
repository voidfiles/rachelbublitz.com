---

I know... It's only the 15th and this post is all about play #20... I'm trying to finish early, okay guys? Take it easy.

Here's the 20th play in the [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/) challenge:

 *Oh, and there are swear words in here, you should know that in case you object to swearing...

###*The Bear Switch*, a short play by Rachel Bublitz

Characters:

Carol, 30 - 60s, f, any race

Glen, 30 - 60s, m, any race

Bear

Setting:

A camp ground in a forest.

*A camp in a forest. CAROL sits, building a fire. GLEN enters at a run.*

GLEN
BEEEEEEAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*GLEN exits at a run. Moment. GLEN re-enters.*

GLEN (*CONTINUED*)
RUN! CAROL, come on let’s GO! THERE’S A BEAR! A BEAR! Are you deaf? Carol?

CAROL
Hush your face, I hear you just fine.

GLEN
Get up! We have to run!

CAROL
Why exactly?

GLEN
THERE’S A FUCKING BEAR!

*BEAR enters.*

BEAR
ROAR!

GLEN
SHIT!

CAROL
Oh, hello!

BEAR
Roar.

CAROL
You’re right on time!

*BEAR nods HIS head.*

GLEN
You are talking to a BEAR? What is going on?

CAROL
You remember how I said I was married before?

GLEN
Um... Yeah...

CAROL
This is my husband.

GLEN
HUSBAND?

CAROL
We were camping... Here, in this forest.

GLEN
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

*BEAR moves aggressively toward GLEN.*

BEAR
ROAR!

CAROL
I’d keep your voice down if I were you. And mind the f-bombs, Mike hates cursing.

GLEN
MIKE?

CAROL
My husband.... The bear!

GLEN
I’m going to go now.

*GLEN moves to exit.*

CAROL
Oh, I’m sorry, you can’t.

*BEAR grabs GLEN and holds him.*

GLEN
But-

CAROL
(*Interrupting*) I’m sorry, you look so confused. I’ll back up... Mike and I were here on vacation. Minding our own business.... Or so we thought. 

BEAR
ROAR!

CAROL
I know, I know... But he deserves an explanation. Anyway, so we were camping, doing out thing, when in the night a witch came upon our campground. We were on the spot her husband was buried. And she was PISSED!... And, understandably, sure... But she should have invested in a grave stone or something, I mean how were we supposed to know?

GLEN
Okay... What does that have to do with me.

CAROL
It was five years ago. She said, the only way to reverse the spell was for us both to come back to the spot in five years... And.... Well have someone take his place.

GLEN
Take his place?

CAROL
That’s where you come in.

GLEN
Wait!

CAROL
Sorry.

GLEN
No! I told you I loved you!

CAROL
I know, it was so sweet.

GLEN
But I bought you a ring, I was going to propose. And if it wasn’t for Mike, I’d have said yes. Really, you’re a great guy.

BEAR
ROAR!

CAROL
We’ll talk about it later, alright? I did what I had to baby.

GLEN
So you tricked me into coming here and-

CAROL
(*Interrupting*) Sh! It’s midnight! LOOK!

*A strange light comes over both BEAR and GLEN, they fall to the floor in pain. GLEN turns into a bear, and BEAR turns into a human male, MIKE.*

MIKE
CAROL!

*CAROL and MIKE kiss.*

GLEN BEAR
RRRROOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR!

CAROL
We have to run! Let’s go!

*GLEN BEAR stops CAROL and MIKE from leaving.*

GLEN BEAR
ROAR!

CAROL
I’m sorry, I don’t... I had to save my husband!

*GLEN BEAR eats CAROL.*

MIKE
NOOOOO!!!!!!!! You killed Carol! That was the love of my life! I’ll kill you!

*GLEN BEAR eats MIKE. End of play.*

I am not at *all* sure how someone could make a person turn into a bear, and have a bear turn into a person on stage, but I'm just the playwright... That's not really my job.
