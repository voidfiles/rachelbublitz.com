One of my favorite weekend activity is reading new plays, and thanks to the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard), I have a plethora of new plays at my finger tips. If you're a playwright, or any kind of theater artist, a membership is worth its weight in gold... Or at least in new plays.

Yesterday, while my kids fought at our rec center pool, I sat in the shade and dug into the world of [Geetha Reddy](https://newplayexchange.org/users/32420/geetha-reddy)'s play [FAR, FAR BETTER THINGS](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/411886/far-far-better-things). My heart is still aching for the women in this play. Here's my full recommendation:

>"A beautiful script. I was so invested in the characters, and their lives, I was on the edge of my seat while reading. My heart was breaking for the lack of options for Pilar, the loneliness of Zoe, the dashed spirit of Dani. I wish I'd seen the production earlier this year, and hoping this play keeps getting produced! Highly recommend reading and producing."

So go and read that play! And then read a whole bunch more.

Happy Sunday!!
