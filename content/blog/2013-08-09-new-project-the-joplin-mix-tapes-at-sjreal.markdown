title: New Project! THE JOPLIN MIX TAPES At SJREAL
---

Super excited to announce that I'm on the writing team for THE JOPLIN MIX TAPES at [SJREAL](http://www.sjrep.com/experience/real/), San Jose Rep's Emerging Artists Lab. This September come and watch the after hours show and you'll get to watch Janis Joplin songs that have been transformed into plays! I'm super excited to be on the team with a super solid team! The song I got is "Mercedes Benz"! 

The Late Night Series of shows on September 13 and 14th @ roughly 10:15pm. And the WONDERFUL writers that will also be working on this project are: [Peter Hsieh](http://peter-hsieh.com/Home_Page.html), Amber Sommerfeld, [Megan Cohen](http://plays.megancohen.com/), and [Jeremy Cole](http://jeremycole.org/)!

I will be giving you more fun details as I get them, so stay tuned!!
