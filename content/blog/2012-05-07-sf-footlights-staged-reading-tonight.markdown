title: SF Footlights Staged Reading Tonight
---

What are you up to tonight? I'm going to SF Footlights staged readings of "Finding Alice" by Jennifer Roberts and "Dry Rot" by Suze Allen. You should come too! It's free and both playwrights are local women (yay!). 

About the plays:

###DRY ROT by Suze Allen
A Seattle couple comes to terms with their marriage in the rainiest season on record. Allie is molding—literally—and Renny is writing a food column and hiding a colossal secret. (15 min)


###FINDING ALICE by Jennifer Roberts
Jennings, a broke, alcoholic American expatriate artist living in Philippines in 1962 is on the verge of losing his rat-infested farmland when he is visited by a young, female artist looking to curate a show for him at the 1964 World's Fair. But she has a secret. Of course. (70 min)

The readings are hosted by Dramatists Guild of America and it's all happening at Stage 2 in San Francisco. Here is the address:

533 Sutter Street, San Francisco, CA 94102

It starts at 7pm, be there or be square!
