title: First Draft of NO MAP Complete
---

Just typed my favorite three words, "end of play," on my first draft of *NO MAP*! It is probably the biggest mess of a first draft I've ever written, but it's finished and I never have to write the first draft of this play again. I've been wanting to write a road trip play for a while now, and while I know it needs a fun-ton of work to get it in any kind of submission ready shape, I'm proud that I got this one out because this play that fought me the whole freaking time. Now to find some kind souls who can lend me their vocal talents for a few hours so I can find out just how much of a hot-mess it really is.

One out of six plays down for 2017! BOOM!
