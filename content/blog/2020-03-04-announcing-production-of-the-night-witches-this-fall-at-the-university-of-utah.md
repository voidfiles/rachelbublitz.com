[*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches) is getting produced at the University of Utah this Fall (the eighty minute version)! Alexandra Harbold will direct again, and I am *THRILLED* to continue my collaboration with her on this project (as we look for more and more and more projects down the line!). We had auditions over the past few weekends, I made it to callbacks this past Sunday where I was blown away by the talent. We could cast this play four times over and I would be happy with each version. This is one of the reasons I wrote this play, we need more roles young women are excited to play, and just more roles for young women in general.

I don't have exact dates yet, or a cast. But all of those juicy bits are coming! So grateful for the opportunity to continue to play with this play!

Salt Lake City, if you missed us last summer, or can't make it up to Park City at the end of this month, you're getting a third chance! Lucky ducks! Everyone else, maybe start thinking about a Fall trip to Utah? It's beautiful with the leaves changing up in the mountains...

More soon!
