+++

September is winding down, we'll start October in just two days, and since I'm heading off for a tiny vacation, this felt like the best time to share my submission total for the month.... It's a good number, I like this number because it gets me closer and closer to my 400 #submissionmission. 

I've submitted to the [Sundance Theatre Lab](http://www.sundance.org/programs/theatre-program) this month, to the [Great Plains Theatre Conference](http://www.gptcplays.com/), to [PlayPenn](https://www.playpenn.org/), and [The National Playwrights Conference at the O'Neill](http://www.theoneill.org/summer-conferences/npc/), to [Berkeley Rep's Ground Floor](https://www.berkeleyrep.org/groundfloor/summerresidency.asp), and [Playwrights Foundation's Bay Area Playwrights Festival](http://playwrightsfoundation.org/submit-a-play/), and many, many, many more. I was a super busy playwright this month. And all those scripts, samples, synopses, and proposals I sent out got me FIFTY FIVE submissions closer! Yep, for the month of September I sent 55 submissions out. It's not my best month of the year, in [March](https://rachelbublitz.com/2017/03/31/march-submissions/) I had 64 submissions, but it'll do. Adding that to all the other months so far in 2017 I have a total of 326 submission! That means I've only got 74 submissions to go to reach my goal! I am SO ready to slay this goal. Bring it on October!
