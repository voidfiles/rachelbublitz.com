---

Here are some awesome submission opportunities. Now go on, and get your work out there!

###1. [Left Coast Theatre Co.](http://leftcoasttheatreco.org/?page_id=19), deadline 4/1/2013

Attention all Playwrights! Left Coast Theatre Company wants your comedic brilliance for our 2013 Fall show:

TWISTED FAIRY TALES

The title says it all. Stories inspired by The Brothers Grimm, Aesop’s Fables, Mother Goose Tales, Hans Christian Anderson, Disney, etc. are welcome. Original fairy tale-esque submissions are also welcome. The more twisted, the better. We’re looking for entries that push boundaries beyond the obvious. Think beyond the “Prince Charming is secretly in love with The Knight in Shining Armor” or “wicked step-sisters played by drag queens” narratives. Think outside the tale!

When is the deadline?
All submissions are due by April 01, 2013

Where do I submit?
Please submit to: [submissions@lctc-sf.org](mailto:submissions@lctc-sf.org)

If you have any questions, please send them to: [submissions@lctc-sf.org](mailto:submissions@lctc-sf.org)

*Plays should be between 10-15 minutes in length.

###2. [Edward Albee Foundation](http://www.albeefoundation.org/Welcome.html), deadline 3/1/2013

The Foundation maintains the William Flanagan Memorial Creative Persons Center (better known as "The Barn") in Montauk, on Long Island in New York, as a residence for writers and visual artists of all media. 

The Center is open from mid-May through mid-October, and can accommodate comfortably up to five persons at a time. Residencies are for 4 or 6 week periods of time. The standards for admission are, simply, talent and need.

Located approximately two miles from the center of Montauk and the Atlantic Ocean, "The Barn" rests in a secluded knoll which offers privacy and a peaceful atmosphere.  The Foundation expects all those accepted for residence to work seriously and to conduct themselves in such a manner as to aid fellow residents in their endeavors.  Writers are offered a room; visual artists are offered a room and studio space.  Residents are responsible for their food, travel, and other expenses.  The environment is simple and communal.  Residents are expected to do their share in maintaining the condition of "The Barn" as well as its peaceful environment.

The Foundation is pleased to accept applications AFTER JANUARY 1, 2013 for the 2013 Summer Season; applications must be post-marked no later than March 1st, 2013 and must arrive--through the mail--no later than March 8th.

###3. [Listen To Your Mother](http://www.listentoyourmothershow.com/sanfrancisco/), deadline 2/24/2013

We are seeking Bay Area writers to read their original essays on any aspect of motherhood. People of all ages, backgrounds and experience levels are encouraged to audition. LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER is a community-oriented celebration of the beauty, the heartbreak, the trials and triumphs that are motherhood.  We encourage diverse perspectives on the subject of mothers and mothering. You don’t need to be a mother to audition, or even a woman! You don’t need to be a writer either, just someone with an original story to tell that comes from your heart.

We are looking for humorous, poignant, painful, joyful or soulful original pieces on mothers and mothering which take three to five minutes to read aloud (please check this before the audition). Previously published work accepted as long as the author retains full rights or has express permission to read the work for this event.

Commitment for cast members includes two group read-throughs in April, a pre-performance run-through at Kanbar Hall and one 7:00 p.m. performance on May 12th.

Mothering in the Bay Area is as diverse as our touted micro-climates. We know there are hundreds of stories here just waiting for a microphone.  We can’t wait to celebrate motherhood with you and we are anxiously awaiting your emails.  Please spread the word from Novato to Gilroy to Walnut Creek!!

If you have any questions that were not answered here, please don’t hesitate to email [ltymsanfrancisco@gmail.com](mailto:ltymsanfrancisco@gmail.com).

Email in your 3-5 minute essay by 2/24/2013, auditions are in March.
