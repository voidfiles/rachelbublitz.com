I wrote a brand new play! Trust me, I am JUST as surprised as you!

[*GHOST HOUSE*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1073841/ghost-house) had a workshop last month with the [Egyptian YouTheatre](https://egyptiantheatrecompany.org/index.php/youtheatre) and is already getting interest in productions for this Fall. Today I sent it off to a few publishers, and I uploaded it to the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) for anyone out there to download and read.

Are you an educator looking for a new digital play for your students? Give *GHOST HOUSE* a read! It's a very silly, maybe a little spooky, flexible cast one-act for middle school performers and older. Here's a brief description:

>"Bane and Corse have a quiet life of checkers, watching live-things out the window, and the occasional thrill of spooking when kids wander willingly into their house just begging to be scared out of their wits! Oh course these ghosts have to spook them!"

Feel free to [email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) if you're not on the New Play Exchange and would like a perusal copy of the script.
