[Outvisible Theatre Company](http://www.outvisibletheatre.com/) announced their dates for their 2018/19 season and their casts for all the shows! [*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) will close their third season next summer, in a *world premiere* production! And now I have officially official dates! *RIPPED* will run July 19-August 4, 2019, and season tickets are now available! Here's Outvisible Theatre Company's full season line-up:

*UNSPORTSMANLINE CONDUCT* (World Premiere) by [Jeff Stolzer](https://newplayexchange.org/users/5761/jeff-stolzer) • September 20-October 7, 2018  
*TURN OF THE SCREW* by [Jeffery Hatcher](https://pwcenter.org/profile/jeffrey-hatcher) • October 26-November 11, 2018  
*VENUS IN FUR* by [David Ives](https://groveatlantic.com/author/david-ives/) • February 14-March 3, 2019  
*A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY UNIT AT MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING CANCER CENTER OF NEW YORK CITY* by [Halley Feiffer](https://atlantictheater.org/playevents/prayforyou/halley-feiffer/) • March 29-April 14, 2019

*RIPPED* (World Premiere) by Rachel Bublitz - (Hey! That's me!) • July 19-August 4, 2019  

No big deal at all, just sharing a season, and taking the spot *next* to one of my favorite plays/playwrights of all time (*HOW I LEARNED TO DRIVE* by Paula Vogel).

[Season subscriptions are on sale now, and can/should be purchased here](https://outvisible.ticketspice.com/seasontickets)! 

I'll be able to tell more soon... But Summer of 2019 is going to be pretty amazing.

Hope you have a great Wednesday!
