title: Finding Joy In Rejections
---

I've been thinking a lot about rejections today. This morning I got an email from [Acme Theater Productions](http://www.acmetheater.com/index.asp)... By the way, thanks for actually sending out rejections, a lot of places you never hear anything. Anyway, I'd sent them two short plays for their upcoming new works festival, and I was not selected. In this place I've decided to work, this creative/subjective space rejections are a constant truth. I'm rejected much more than I am selected... That's one of the big reasons why I submit as much as I do, cast a wide net and you get more fish. 

Also, making the selections for the [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/) anthology and internet reading made me see the selection process from the other side. It's really hard rejecting people. It's like auditioning, you never feel the same way about it after you've had to be an auditor. 

I enjoy rejection letters, it makes me feel like I'm pushing as hard as I can... Otherwise I wouldn't get any rejection letters in the mail.... I'd probably get a whole lot of nothing. 

I guess the point that I'm trying to get to, is don't take rejections so hard. Get back up and move on to what's next. And know that it doesn't mean that you don't do good work... I know! We had to turn down some great plays last week. There's a lot of talent out there, all you can do is your best and keep pushing forward.
