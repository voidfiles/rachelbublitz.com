*The Fantasy Club* will be going up in San Francisco at [The Alcove Theater](http://thealcovetheater.com/) this August, and I'm over-the-moon-happy to announce specific dates! So people, mark your calendars!

*The Fantasy Club* happens to be my first play. It's had many a drafts, and I learned a tremendous amount working on it. I can't wait to see it coming to life on stage, and I do hope you can join us! Cast and other details will be announced soon, for now, save the date!

Here's a bit more about the play:

Who says men own the monopoly on sex fantasies? Pull the sheets off of one stay-at-home mom's dirty little secret in *The Fantasy Club*. Frances is beginning to discover that she is more than just a wife and mother. Sheâ€™s writing poetry again, poetry inspired by her sexual fantasies. Soon she comes face to face with the object of these fantasies and is given the opportunity to make them a reality. Will Frances risk her family for her fantasy?
