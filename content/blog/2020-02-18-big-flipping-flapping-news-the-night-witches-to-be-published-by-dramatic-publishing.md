I AM GOING TO TRY HARD TO NOT SHOUT THIS ENTIRE BLOG POST, BUT I MAKE NO PROMISES, BECAUSE....

## *THE NIGHT WITCHES* IS BEING PUBLISHED BY [DRAMATIC PUBLISHING](https://www.dramaticpublishing.com/)!

THREE CHEERS!  
HIP HIP HOORAY!  
TIME TO PAINT THE TOWN!  
SMOKE 'EM IF YOU GOT 'EM!

I am so THRILLED! I am jumping over the earth, moon, and stars excited to have *THE NIGHT WITCHES* join Dramatic Publishing's catalogue.

BOTH the 60 minute version AND the 80 minute version will be available *and* there will be instructions on how to cut down the 60 minute version for a 35/40-ish minute version for those one-act competitions.

AHHHHHHHHH!

I'm really happy and proud. And I can't wait to hold these shiny scripts in my hand. I will be posting all about each step of the publishing process, so be sure to check back and hear more about when you can buy and/or license this play!
