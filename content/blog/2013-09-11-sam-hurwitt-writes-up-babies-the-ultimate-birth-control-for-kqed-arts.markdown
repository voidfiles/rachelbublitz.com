title: Sam Hurwitt Writes Up BABIES THE ULTIMATE BIRTH CONTROL For KQED Arts
---

[Sam Hurwitt](http://www.kqed.org/arts/profile/index.jsp?essid=114288), editor-in-chief of Theatre Bay Area magazine and theater critic for the Marin Independent Journal, brought up [BABIES, The Ultimate Birth Control](https://www.facebook.com/events/158170084370589/) in an article he wrote for [KQED Arts](http://www.kqed.org/), [Choose Your Own Adventure at the SF Fringe Fest](http://www.kqed.org/arts/performance/article.jsp?essid=125813)! 

Sam writes:

>"Other shows really highlight the grab bag nature of the Fringe. All Terrain Theater's Babies, the Ultimate Birth Control zooms through seven short vignettes by Tracy Held Potter and Rachel Bublitz about the trials and tribulations of parenting, performed by a versatile cast of four and directed by local actor Elena Wright. Highlights include Potter's look at a working mom finding herself too thoroughly replaced by a too-competent nanny; Bublitz's no-holds-barred negotiations between an opportunistic baby (played by a full-grown man) and his mom about nap time; and Potter's attempt to turn an anti-feminist bedtime story into something more empowering."
