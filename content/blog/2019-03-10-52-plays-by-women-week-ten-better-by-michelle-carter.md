Time was catching up to me this past week! I'm in the middle of rewriting [*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches) and my daughter was in a three-day state championship swim meet here in Utah. But, I did manage to read a new play by one of my the best writing teachers I ever had the pleasure of learning from, [Michelle Carter](https://newplayexchange.org/users/3199/michelle-carter). Michelle is also an amazing writer, and I loved diving into her play [*BETTER*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/29889/better). Here's my [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard) recommendation:

>"A moving and emotionally full play about dealing with the unthinkable. Carter uses humor and a matter-of-fact protagonist to juxtapose the gravity the world sheâ€™s created. I would love to see this in production. A fantastic play."

Can you believe we're already TEN weeks into 2019? Oy Vey!

Hope everyone loses their hour this week with patience, grace, and secret naps.
