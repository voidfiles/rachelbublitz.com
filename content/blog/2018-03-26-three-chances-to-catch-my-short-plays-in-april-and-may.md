+++

This year's #submissionmission is *already* paying off big time with my short plays! And depending on where you live, or how much you like to travel, you'll have THREE chances to catch my short work being performed all over the place in the next two month.....

Kicking off April 9th, my awful (yes, I said awful!) play, *THE SONGS OF HELL*, will be performed in Another Taste of Awful with [Cupcake Lady Productions](http://cupcakeladyproductions.com/)! It'll be pitted against other "rotten" plays, and judged. Fingers crossed that mine takes the prize of being the best of the worst (maybe?)! You can catch Another Taste of Awful in New York City, at [The Producer's Club in The Prince Theater](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/the+producers+club/@40.7594238,-74.0614022,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25853b1da3fc5:0xbdc1363858b80c22!2m2!1d-73.9913623!2d40.759445) at 7:00pm on Monday, April 9th.

Next up, [*LEAN IN WITH LIZ*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/62085/lean-liz) will have a reading with [Clamour Theatre](http://clamourtheatre.org/) in Florida, the sunshine state! If you're near Orange Park, Florida, on Friday April 27th be sure to check out this night of five 10-minute plays. [And you can reserve your spot for the event, called "Ages and Stage" here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ages-and-stages-tickets-44470117318).

AND, as of this morning, I just learned that [*MY BODY*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/2541/my-body) has been selected for [Horatio Theatre](https://www.scifitheatre.com/)'s "Science Fiction - Double Feature" festival!! The festival will run May 22nd - 26th all the way in Edinburgh! Which might make it difficult for some to drive there, especially those living here in the States, but I believe in you. This will be the first international production of *MY BODY*, and my first production in Scotland... Might be time to get a world map and put pins in all the cool places my work has been done, so far other than the United States I could check off England and Egypt! 

Okay, I'm going to let you go now, you've got a fun-ton of travel to work out.

Happy Monday!
