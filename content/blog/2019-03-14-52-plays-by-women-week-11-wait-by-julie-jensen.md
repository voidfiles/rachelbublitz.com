It's March 14th, Pi Day, and my daughter's 11th birthday!

I also read another great play today for the [52 Plays by Women](https://twitter.com/52playsbywomen) reading/watching/hearing challenge. Today I read *WAIT!* by the phenomenal [Julie Jensen](https://newplayexchange.org/users/7849/julie-jensen).

Julie is a treasured and renowned member of the Utah theater world, one of the first playwrights I met here in Salt Lake City, and an all-around fantastic human. She's a resident playwright at [Salt Lake Acting Company](https://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/), member of the [Plan-B Theatre](https://planbtheatre.org/) Writers Lab, is the former local [Dramatists Guild](https://www.dramatistsguild.com/) Rep, is an affiliated writer with the [Playwrights' Center](https://pwcenter.org/), has had a Rolling World Premiere with the [National New Play Network](http://nnpn.org/), she's won tons of awards, and has been produced all around the country. [Pygmalion Theatre](http://pygmalionproductions.org/) here in Salt Lake just closed Julie's *WAIT!* and my schedule kept me from seeing the show live. Luckily, Julie emailed me the script. The play follows potential actor Wendy Burger, a UPS driver, who's in the process of figuring out who she is and where she fits in the world. It's filled with so much humor, love, and ridiculous theater. Her dialogue really leaps off the script, it made me sad I missed the production!

Julie has a few scripts up on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/users/7849/julie-jensen), I highly recommend checking her out there... Sadly, *WAIT!* isn't one of the available titles, but there is plenty to give you a taste of her humor and wit.

Happy Thursday!
