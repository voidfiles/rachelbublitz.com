It's a chilly Thursday morning and I've got some great news! *TWO* of my one-act plays are now licensed and available for your production right inquiries!

I wrote *GHOST HOUSE* over the summer once it became clear that workshopping *THE SUMMER I HOWLED* would be difficult to do digitally. So the Egyptian YouTheatre used that time to help me develop a brand new specifically digital play! It was hard for my brain to wrap around the restraints and strengths of this new format, but my week working with kids set me on my path. Fast forward to now, and *GHOST HOUSE* is now licensed and published with [Playscripts](https://www.playscripts.com/play/4701)! It's a fun and spooky 30-ish minute play with a super flexible cast between 4 and 10 folks of any gender. Here's more about the play:

>In their quiet afterlife, Bane and Corse play checkers, write songs, and get one occasional thrill: spooking the kids who wander into their house. And as luck would have it, tonight some little live things DO slink in. Gray and a group of pals hope to gain bragging rights by spending the whole night in this, the hauntedest of all haunted houses. Meanwhile Gray's older sibling Royal brings friends to try and scare Gray's group out of their wits. But they soon find out Bane and Corse have that covered! Surprises are everywhere in this silly, spooky play written especially for online performance.

Several years ago I wrote *THE RED HOUSE MONSTER* for the [San Francisco Olympians Festival](http://sfolympians.com/), and it's now available for licensing through [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/)! This year I've decided if it doesn't make sense to send plays out in mass for production, might as well try and get them published when and where I can! I love this play, and I'm so glad for it to have found a home with Stage Partners. I've also written some ideas and tips on performing this play outside and socially distanced, as a radio play, and as a digital piece of theater. More about this play:

>The story of Hannah Gold, a young lady living on an island off the coast of Massachusetts in the late 1800s, and the night that changed her life. Filled with small town lore, haunted houses, spirits, monsters, pistols, pie, and mysteries, it is a play that will keep you guessing just what is in the Red House, and who, in fact, you should be afraid of. Inspired by the myth of Geryon and Hercules, and Shirley Jackson's "We Have Always Lived in the Castle."
