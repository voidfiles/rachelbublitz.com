+++

I read SO MANY PLAYS in November..... Most of which were not on the [New Play Exchange](https://newplayexchange.org/dashboard). Last month I was a reader for a ten-minute play competition and had over 60 plays on my assigned to me. It was fun to be on the other side of things, but it limited the amount I could read and recommend on the New Play Exchange for sure. BUT, what I did get to I really loved.... 

Here are all the plays I recommended last month:

* [*Restore*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/17805/restore) by Jordan Ramirez Puckett  
* [*The Wolves*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/27217/wolves) by Sarah DeLappe  
* [*The Bone Orchard*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/18906/bone-orchard) by Elyzabeth Gregory Wilder  
* [*The American Play*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/140316/american-play) by Ashley Jacobson  
* [*Refuge*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/259728/refuge) by Rachel Lynett  

And actually, seeing them all listed I'm realizing that those are all full-length plays and I'm feeling much better at the amount of work I recommended in November, recommending five full-lengths in a month ain't bad at all. Anyway, go and read these plays! You will not be disappointed.

Three cheers for new plays!!! And three cheers for the New Play Exchange!!!
