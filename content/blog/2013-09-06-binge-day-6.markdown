title: Binge Day 6, 7 Plays Submitted!
---

It's September, which means [playwrightbinge](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/playwrightbinge/info)! That means along with a ton of other playwrights, I'm submitting 30 plays this month!... Or at least *hoping* to submit that much. It's a nice project to do after [31 Plays in 31 Days](http://31plays31days.com/) because you have to rework all your new stuff and get it out there in the world. It is day six in the binge, and I'm up to seven plays! Woo! Hope I can keep it up.

Anyway, without further audieu, here's where I sent my plays, hope you find some use in the info (as in, send your plays there too!):

[New Georges](http://www.newgeorges.org/) is always looking for new women playwrights to work with. If you want to get involved mail them a copy of a full length play! I sent in *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats*.

I also sent *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* to [Playwrights Horizon](http://www.playwrightshorizons.org/). They look for full-length script on an on-going basis.

[Acme Theater](http://www.acmetheater.com/index.asp) seeks 10-minute plays! I sent in *Baby Shower Games*, because previous productions are just fine with them, although they don't want the scripts to have been published. The material you send them can be comedy or drama, without strong language. The deadline is coming up quickly on this opportunity, you have until September 8, 2013.

I sent two scripts into [Milwaukee Rep](http://www.milwaukeerep.com/index.htm?id=&epslanguage=en); *Peeper*, and *Horny Like The Wolf*. They're seeking scripts between 30 seconds and 20 minutes, have 1 - 12 actors, and allow for a multi-ethnic cast with age ranges from 22 and 35. Deadline is September 16, 2013, and you can send in as many scripts that fit the bill.

I also sent *Baby Shower Games* to the [Lakeshore Player's](http://www.lakeshoreplayers.com/) playwright contest. They want 10 minute scripts with 5 or less characters. Deadline is November 15, 2013.

And finally I sent *Under The Gods' Golden Cleats* to the [PlayPenn](http://www.playpenn.org/) Conference, which will take play next summer. That deadline is September 30, 2013.

Got all that? Good! I'm up to 7, only 23 more to go!
