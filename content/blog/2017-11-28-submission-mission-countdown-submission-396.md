It's #GivingTuesday, so before I get to my submission, I'd like to encourage you to find your favorite theater's website and send some $$$ their way. Today I donated to [Plan-B Theatre](http://planbtheatre.org/), [Shotgun Players](https://shotgunplayers.org/Online/default.asp), [Killing My Lobster](http://www.killingmylobster.com/), [Awesome Theatre](https://awesometheatre.org/), [Salt Lake Acting Company](http://www.saltlakeactingcompany.org/), and [Good Company Theatre](https://www.goodcotheatre.com/). I could go on giving forever, because I love soooooo many theaters, but my bank account doesn't agree with me. That's why I need you to help out! If we all give to our favorites, I'm 99% sure they'll all get covered by the end of the day, that's probably how math works.

And now for submission #396! I sent a sample of *RIPPED*, along with some supporting material, to [Moonshot Theatre Company](https://www.moonshottheatre.org/submissions/) in New York. They're looking for one-act and full-length plays, specifically work that is "Entertaining, Bold, Relevant, Live and Collaborative." They'd also like it to be production ready.

Now back to work, I've gotta get a new draft of *MOMMY DANCES WITH THE DEVIL* done by Friday! 

Happy Giving Tuesday!
