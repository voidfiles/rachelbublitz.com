title: Excited To Be Back For My Second Year At PlayGround!
---

Very happy to announce that I will join the [PlayGround](http://playground-sf.org/) Writers Pool for the second year! You'll probably want to get a subscription, just in case any of my plays make it in... Here's the box office link for that: [playground-sf.org/boxoffice/](http://playground-sf.org/boxoffice/). 

This year's Monday Night PlayGround series will go up on the following dates:

Oct 20, 2014 @ 8PM

Nov 17, 2014 @ 8PM

Dec 15, 2014 @ 8PM

Jan 26, 2015 @ 8PM

Feb 16, 2015 @ 8PM

Mar 16, 2015 @ 8PM

All performances will be held at [Berkeley Rep](http://www.berkeleyrep.org/). If you've never made it out for Monday Night PlayGround, it is a ton of fun. A lot of magic in the air as a ton of artists put some very, *very*, fresh plays up and on their feet. And if you've come out before, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

SO! Subscribe! And keep an eye and ear out for my news, you never know when a play of mine will get picked!
