title: Developmental Reading Oct 1 for MY SISTER'S BABY
---

[Playwright's Center of San Francisco](http://playwrightscentersf.org/) has selected my other full length play to be a part of their fall reading series! Yay! So, October 1, MY SISTER'S BABY will get a developmental reading. What is a developmental reading? Oh, I'm so glad you asked.... A developmental reading has no rehearsal, the actors will get the script about a week in advance and will read it out without practice or guidance. It's helpful for me to hear the piece as a whole, and hopefully this will gear me up for my next draft of this play. The reading will be in San Francisco, and the 1st is a Monday. 

I'll be posting more details as we get closer, but for now mark your calendars!
