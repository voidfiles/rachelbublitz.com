I drove up to Park City this morning for the *first* cast read through of *CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*! And let me tell you, they are KILLER. I got goose bumps hearing it, and those bumps just got bigger and bigger as we heard from the director ([Alicia Washington](https://www.goodcotheatre.com)) and producer (Jamie Wilcox) of the show after. THE SHOW IS GOING TO BE SO GREAT! OH MAN!

Here's the sneakiest of sneak peeks... A little video of our intrepid sci-fi obsessed hero Gilda, convincing the cheer squad to help her defeat the aliens:

AND AND AND! Tickets are on sale! And you should buy one or ten or a hundred, because the show WILL 100% sell out. Here's the link for tickets: [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS* World Premiere Tickets!](http://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/index.php?option=com_holdmyticket&view=event&id=299374)
