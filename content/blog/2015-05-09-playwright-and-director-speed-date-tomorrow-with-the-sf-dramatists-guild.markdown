title: Playwright And Director Speed Date Tomorrow With The Bay Area Dramatists Guild
---

Tomorrow from 11 to 1 at [Tides Theatre](http://www.tidestheatre.org/) join me and the Bay Area Dramatists Guild for their first ever [Playwright & Director Speed Dating Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/642278275804411/)! From the Facebook event page:

>"Directors can be tremendous advocates for new work being developed and produced. If you feel like you could benefit from knowing more directors, please join the Bay Area Dramatists Guild for a Playwright and Director Speed Dating session!

>Bagels and coffee included for this free event!"

I don't know about you, but I'm always looking for reasons to get into a room and talk shop with fellow artists. This is a great opportunity to share why you're passionate about theater, and what you hope to share with the world. And you never know, you might meet your next major collaborator!

Some get those business cards ready and come get your networking on!
