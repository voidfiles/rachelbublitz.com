title: Staged Reading of RIPPED With San Francisco Playhouse October 24th at 7pm
---

Turns out I can't stay away from the Bay Area that long, I'm coming back toward the end of this month for a staged reading of my play *Ripped* with [San Francisco Playhouse](http://sfplayhouse.org/sfph/)! I have felt so much urgency writing this play, and I can't wait to hear it in front of an audience. ESPECIALLY because I'll be completely spoiled with the other amazing artists involved; [Claire Rice](http://claireannrice.blogspot.com/) is directing, and we have the incredibly talented cast of Lindsay Schmeltzer, Ron Chapman, and Thomas Gorrebeeck!

*Ripped* deals with the complexities and nuances of the sensitive issue of rape. It is my hope that it leaves the audience questioning their own definitions of rape. Here’s the synopsis:      
                                              
>Lucy, a freshman in college, is torn between her excitement about the new people in her life and having to leave her old life and loves behind. As she struggles to find a balance between the new and the old, a sexual encounter leaves her confused and concerned that she may have been a victim of rape. The play moves back and forth through time and space as Lucy tries to piece together the unraveling the events and interactions between herself and the two young men she’s torn between.
