[*RIPPED*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/70552/ripped) is getting its World Premiere production in 2019 with [Z Space](http://www.zspace.org/)! I have known about this for weeks and have managed to keep a lid on it but now I get to shout it from the rooftops! I AM SO THRILLED! This play has had a lot of false starts and I couldn't be happier that its first production will be with the generous and wonderful artists at Z Space. And! Oh yes! AND Executive Artistic Director [Lisa Steindler](http://www.zspace.org/people/) will be directing! It was a dream to work with Lisa during the Problematic Play Festival, and I'm the luckiest playwright because the dream just keeps going!

*RIPPED* will run in San Francisco May 22 - June 22, 2019, and auditions are coming up quick! Here's the audition notice, or [read it on Z Space's page here](http://www.zspace.org/rippedshow):
