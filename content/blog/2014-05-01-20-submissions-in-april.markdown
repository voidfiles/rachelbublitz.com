title: 20 Submissions In April
---

April was a slow month for submitting. I got 20 scripts out, instead of the 30 I was hoping for... But that just means I'll have to bring it extra hard this month. This year's total so far is 130 though, and since we're only on day 120, I'm still a little ahead.

May's going to be big though, I can feel it. There are a lot of great competitions with deadlines at the end of this month, so watch out folks... I'm sending plays your way.
