title: 'Recommended Show: THE SHAKESPEARE BUG From Killing My Lobster'
---

On Saturday after I was delighted with the opening performance of my fringe show ([BABIES, The Ultimate Birth Control](https://www.facebook.com/events/158170084370589/)), I headed over to Stage Werx for [Killing My Lobster](https://www.facebook.com/killingmylobster)'s [*The Shakespeare Bug* by Ken Slattery](https://www.facebook.com/events/1394821104074102/). What a hilarious show! The script is funny and clever, the cast was incredibly talented, and the effects were impressive too. Thumbs up all around!

The show is running through September 29th, you should get your tickets and see it! Buy your tickets here: [http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/393914](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/393914).
