I don't know about you, but my April flew by. Packing, unpacking, airplanes, openings, new drafts, meetings, final exams, grading papers, and probably a lot more that I can't remember because it all happened way too fast. I barely had time to send scripts off this month, so I'm pretty pleased my number for the month of April is over 0. 

And what is that magic number? Well, I'll tell you... April I got it together enough to send out NINETEEN scripts! Which is dismal compared to March, BUT pretty amazing considering the month I've had. April's tally brings my submission total for the year up to 138! And since today is the 121st day of the year, I'm still on track to break my 2014 record of 366 submission. Can I do it? Guess we'll find out together.

And if anyone out there is wondering where the heck I find all these opportunities, right now I'm making my way through the [2017 Dramatists Guild Resource Directory](http://www.lulu.com/shop/dramatists-guild/2017-dramatists-guild-resource-directory/paperback/product-23132779.html). It has a nifty submission calendar right in the front that lists monthly deadlines. Good luck and happy submitting!
