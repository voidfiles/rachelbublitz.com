The first production of the new full-length version of [*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches) has been canceled in response to COVID-19. The [Egyptian YouTheatre](https://egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) plans to reschedule the production once it is recommended to do so.

The full-length draft is up on the New Play Exchange, you can find it [right here](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches) if you'd like. I will post updates about as soon as I have them.

For now, be well, be safe, wash your hands!
