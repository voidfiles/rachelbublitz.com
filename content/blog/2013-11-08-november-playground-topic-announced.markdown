title: November PlayGround Topic Announced
---

The topic has been announced for [PlayGround](http://www.playground-sf.org/)'s November musical theater month, and this time there's a twist! Instead of writing original songs we are to use and/or be inspired by one of 13 songs from [Ira and George Gershwin](http://gershwin.com/home). If you're curious or would like to write your own play based on this prompt, here are the songs:

1. *But Not For Me*
1. *Embraceable You*
1. *Fascinatin' Rhythm*
1. *Funny Face*
1. *How Long Has This Been Going On*
1. *Lady Be Good*
1. *Let's Call The Whole Thing Off*
1. *Love Walked In*
1. *Our Love Is Here To Stay*
1. *Someone To Watch Over Me*
1. *Strike Up The Band*
1. *Sâ€™Wonderful*
1. *They Can't Take That Away From Me*

We will have a piano on stage and a very talented musician, Steve Sanders, playing for us. This is going to be a great evening, the show will go up on Monday, November 18th, I'd recommend getting your tickets now! Do that here: [http://www.playground-sf.org/boxoffice/](http://www.playground-sf.org/boxoffice/)

Now I've got to get to writing!
