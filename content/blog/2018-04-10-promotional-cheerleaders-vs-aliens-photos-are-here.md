Home again and trying to hit the ground running as much as possible as I get back into the grove. I have SO MANY THINGS TO CATCH UP ON! This week I'll be posting a ton making up for my week off, so if you want to be in the know, be sure to check back. 

Today I have some very exciting things to share.... Promotional photos for the upcoming World Premiere of [*CHEERLEADERS VS. ALIENS*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/119869/cheerleaders-vs-aliens) at the [Egyptian Youtheatre](https://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/youtheatre) are here! I know I'm biased, but these pictures LOOK AMAZING!

Sirius (JT O'Reilly), Gamma (Anna Diamond), and Canopus (Mallory Koshiba) are don't know what's coming for them.)
