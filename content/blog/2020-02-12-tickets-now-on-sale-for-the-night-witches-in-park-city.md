Hip hip hooray! You can purchase your tickets for [*THE NIGHT WITCHES*](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/278583/night-witches) today!

We have an amazing cast, Alexandra Harbold is back to direct, and the script has two more characters and has been expanded into a full-length! If you were able to see the show at the Great Salt Lake Fringe Festival, you know how special it is, and you won't want to miss it this time around. AND, if you were one of the folks who wasn't able to get tickets (because we SOLD OUT OUR ENTIRE RUN - WOOHOO!) life has given you one of those rare do-over moments.

### *THE NIGHT WITCHES*  
At the brand new Egyptian Black Box Theatre!    

Friday, March 27, at 7pm  
Saturday, March 28, at 2pm & 7pm  
Sunday, March 29, at 2pm & 6pm  

Recommended for ages 10+

[Buy tickets HERE](http://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/component/holdmyticket/?view=event&id=356049)!

I cannot recommend buying your tickets in advance enough, I'm pretty sure we're gonna pack the house. Don't miss out, and buy today!

See you at the show!
