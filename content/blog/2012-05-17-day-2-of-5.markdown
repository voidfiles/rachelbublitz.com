title: Day 2 of 5
---

Today I wrote a new play! It's called "Ghost Story" and it's scary as hell. At least I think so. A few months back I wrote a ten minute play based on a nightmare, it's called "Baby Pie" and it's a farce, not scary at all. "Ghost Story" gave me chills while writing it. It weighs in at 12 pages, so it's technically not a ten minute play but a one act. I can't decide if I should leave it as is, slim it down to ten, or bulk it up to fifteen or twenty pages. Hmmm... So far (mind you I'm only on day 2) I'm really enjoying my little warm up. We'll see how I'm doing on day 5 though.

Want to know just how scary "Ghost Story" is? Shoot me an email, I'd love to get outside feedback!
