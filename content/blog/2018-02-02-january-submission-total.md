Time to check in on my #submissionmission status (drumroll please).................. For the month of January I submitted 48 times! That is six more submissions than my January total from last year. And while I know submitting like I do is crazy, I'm feeling a ton of benefits already from last year's mission, I have two short plays going up next month, one one-minute play (*PEPE LE PEW*) in [Spokane Stage Left](http://spokanestageleft.org/)'s Fast & Furious, a reading of *MY BODY* in the [Kennedy Center ACTF Region 7](http://kcactf7.org/) Conference which also happens to be happening in Spokane, Washington, I just licensed two children's plays (making dollar dollar bills!) which I'll tell you more about very soon, and of course *RIPPED* being a *finalist* in the [Detroit New Works Festival](https://us12.campaign-archive.com/?u=a6d0765e0d58da881d1c34a0b&id=5ddd7d22cd)! Getting plays up is a lot about the quality of the work, and also the people you know, of course, but it's also a numbers game. The more you submit, the more chances you get.

Here's to hoping I can keep this momentum up through February! Happy Friday everyone, enjoy your weekend!!
