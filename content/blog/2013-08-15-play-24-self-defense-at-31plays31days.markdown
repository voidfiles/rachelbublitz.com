And now a one-minute play I call *Self Defense*. This one was a lot of fun to write.

###*Self Defense* a one-minute play by Rachel Bublitz

Characters:

Iris, f, 25 - 65, any race.

Helen, f, 25 - 65, any race.

Jamison, m, 35 - 85, any race.

Setting:

A kitchen.

*IRIS is on stage, HELEN enters.*

HELEN
I came as fast as I could.

IRIS
It will not do a bit of good. He is going to die.

HELEN
But I brought the antidote! You are saved!

*HELEN gives IRIS a small vile.*

IRIS
Alas he lies lifeless on the floor! I called upon you too late!

HELEN
Pull it together! There may still be hope. Where does he lay?

IRIS
Behind the sofa in the big room, when I checked upon him last his breath was only slight.

*JAMISON enters, goes to IRIS, and puts HIS hands around IRIS’ throat.*

JAMISON
You think a little poison can kill me?

IRIS
Helen! HELP!

*HELEN takes out a gun and shoots JAMISON. JAMISON dies.*

HELEN
He’s dead.

IRIS
Yes. But now we are back to the original problem.

HELEN
No, my dear, now it is self defense.

*End of play.*
