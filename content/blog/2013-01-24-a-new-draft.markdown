title: A New Draft!
---

I have been so sick. Since last Saturday I've had a fever on and off and constant aches and pains, it's been no fun. Needless to say, my house is a mess and I haven't gotten a lot of writing done. Today I felt much better and so I edited my draft of my play about Achilles. It's three acts, 127 pages, and finally in a place where I'm not embarrassed to let people read it. I'm feeling really great about it, which means it's time for new eyes to look it over and tell me everything that's wrong with it. Want to help? You have two choices, join me on March 3rd for the living room read with [Pacifica Table Readers](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Pacifica_table_readers/)! It's a Sunday, and bring a friend that likes to read.... My cast is HUGE (7 m, 8-10 f).

Your other option would be to [email me](mailto:rnbublitz@gmail.com) and tell me you're wanting to read it. I need feedback from people who know nothing about Greek mythology AND people who know a ton, and everyone in between. 

And no, it doesn't have a title yet. I don't want to talk about that.
