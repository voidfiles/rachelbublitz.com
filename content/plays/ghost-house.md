In their quiet afterlife, Bane and Corse play checkers, write songs, and get one occasional thrill: spooking the kids who wander into their house. And as luck would have it, tonight some little live things DO slink in. Gray and a group of pals hope to gain bragging rights by spending the whole night in this, the hauntedest of all haunted houses. Meanwhile Gray's older sibling Royal brings friends to try and scare Gray's group out of their wits. But they soon find out Bane and Corse have that covered! Surprises are everywhere in this silly, spooky play written especially for online performance.
