The evening spirals out of control for Luke and Chloe, as the two try desperately to hold onto one another as their situation changes. Luke, an almost thirty year old assistant manager at Target, has put together a celebration for his co-worker and girlfriend, Chloe, who happens to still be in high school. Unfortunately, whatâ€™s good news for Luke devastates Chloe, and she lashes out with the only weapon she has until a new balance can be reached between them. Break Room is one continuous scene with two characters.
