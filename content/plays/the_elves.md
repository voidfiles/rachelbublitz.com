Sandy and Dennis have the perfect plan: crash the “pre-ride” festivities on Christmas Eve at Santa’s Workshop…and make off with more toys than they can dream of. But Santa’s elves have other ideas. Can Sandy and Dennis escape the clutches of these rhyming terrors, or will the two toy-hungry kids find themselves on the post-ride menu…?
