 Football is life, and boys are men in this twenty minute one act about gender roles. Chris is having a day the worst day of his young life, he’s been dumped by his girlfriend, and is possibly kicked off the football team, when he accidentally hits a raccoon. When he discovers the animal is dead everything proves too much and Chris falls to pieces, which prompts Brandon, his best friend and most true worshiper, to follow suit. Because if the star of your life isn’t a star, what does that make you? Toxic is a fast ride about status, masculinity, and how people are and are not allowed to behave.
