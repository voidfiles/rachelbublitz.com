The first women to fly in combat flew for Russia during the second world war, they were known as the Night Witches. They flew in planes made of canvas and wood, and dropped their bombs on their German enemy every fifteen minutes during the night to keep them from sleeping. Using movement, song, and lyrically styled dialogue we follow these brave women through one evening during the war.

{{< quote "Julie Hirschi for the Salt Lake Tribune" "https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2019/08/09/great-salt-lake-fringe/" >}}The production by Park City's Egyptian YouTheater is spellbinding and haunting, pushing the boundaries of what a youth theater production can achieve. The nine young actresses captured the hearts of theatergoers.{{< /quote >}}
