After moving across the country, Laurel, the mother of a young child, is desperate to make a friend beyond her cheerio-throwing, Barney-obsessed baby and her over-worked, rarely-home husband, which leads her to jump for a spot in a mommy group with a mysterious reputation. Laurel is cemented in the group before she learns of their devious agenda and is forced to either shut up and join suit, or burn their coven to the ground.
