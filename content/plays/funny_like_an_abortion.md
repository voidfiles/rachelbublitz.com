Monroe finds herself knocked up, and since abortions are illegal in the United States, she throws a surprise abortion party with her best friend Jade. Monroe prepares over twenty at home abortion options for them to sort through, neither will walk away until they select the best of all of these terrible options. But that's not all! Come on down for juggling, a tap dancing number, and a horrific view at what our future may hold.

A comedic two-hander in one scene.

{{< quote "New play ‘Funny, Like an Abortion’ is dystopia too close to home on N.J. stage" "https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2023/11/new-play-funny-like-an-abortion-is-dystopia-too-close-to-home-on-nj-stage-review.html" >}}Bublitz situates herself in a theatrical milieu populated by the likes of Samuel Beckett, Caryl Churchill, and even Martin McDonagh. Those giants have populated their stages with worlds that look very much like our own, but are askew in ways that highlight and underscore the absurdity that so often goes unrecognized. Like Beckett, Bublitz relies on dark, penetrating comedy, but like Churchill, Bublitz’s work is unflinching in its critique of destructive power. The result, in “Funny, Like an Abortion,” is a play that very much wants audiences to enjoy its hijinks, but also refuses to allow those audiences to laugh away the horror it ponders.{{< /quote >}}

It’s worked before, when desperate times demanded art make itself heard above the babble. “Funny, Like an Abortion” literally screams its intentions. You may be angered, saddened, inspired or disgusted, but you will not leave this show unmoved.{{< /quote >}}
