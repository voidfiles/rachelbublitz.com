Andy’s best friends, Logan, Marcus, and George decide it’s time they step in after he’s been dumped by his long time girlfriend Megan, to snap him out of his funk. All three of them have different ideas of what Andy actually needs, and so Andy is dragged to the gym, the bar, and a cabin in the woods before things come to a head and he declares that he doesn’t need fixing. By the end of the play, with all four playing video games in Andy’s safe place, his couch, they realize that there’s no fixing anyone, and all any of us can really ask for is friendship that is focused on acceptance for who we are.
