Jordan gets kicked out of class for talking. But a zero on the test may be the least of Jordan’s problems when a pencil starts to talk—and then a locker and a mop and a slew of other inanimate objects. Maybe Jordan’s going crazy, but Jordan’s not the only one, as soon a hall monitor, the custodian, a teacher and the principal join in as they try to get to the bottom of all the yammering in this comedy inspired by an African folk tale.
